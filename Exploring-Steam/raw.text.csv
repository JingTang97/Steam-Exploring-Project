												The developer is responsible for the massive amounts of cheating and racism that occurs on this game.The loot crate system has a corrupted market. Players aren't cheating to hurt people, it's because of money. Banning won't fix this as they use the earned money to easily gain entrance; this is a job for people, they're not going to stop cheating because it replaces their jobs with something fun.THE DEVELOPER KNEW THAT GIVING UP THE LOOT CRATES WAS THE ANSWERI'm not buying anything made by Brendan Greene

												This game is like dating an alcoholic. They're a lot of fun to be around, and you legitimately like them. But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship. You keep thinking they'll change, but they never will. Instead they'll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their body.

												This game was killed by greedy and incompetent developers. They have made A LOT of money out of us, but they still refused to fix their game, they kept releasing broken updates while turning a blind eye on actual problems such as rampant cheating. They said there would be no micro transactions before the game left EA; they lied. They said the game left early access; they lied, it's still not as optimized as a game this big should be. They are sueing Epic Games because they are seeing a dip into their profits and they are too self absorbed to realize their own incompetence is turning players away, not a better competitor.This company is interested in creating more paid content, they don't care about fixing what they already have now, they don't care about you.

													Early Access Review
								PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one. Welcome to the battleground.

												Skip it till they lock the chinese hackers to their own server, or maybe start banning them.  Game is currently ... INFESTED with worthless no talent cheaters.

												Having played this game for almost a year, and more than 700 hours, I can't lie -- it's an addictive game.  ""just one more round"" -- next thing I know it's 3AM.  The only saving grace is that my wife plays with me, and sometimes without me :).  Ere go, I get away with playing a lot.That said, I am writing off playing third person.  The cheating is SO blatant, SO regular, and SO poorly handled, and with today's release from BattleEye that 99% of the cheaters are from one specific country, it isn't even fun any more.  I reject the comments from the developers that we shouldn't be ""racist.""  I like all people...who play by the rules.  I don't mind getting creamed, as long as it's legitimate.  I don't even check the names any more to see who killed me, though I still report them.  I receive ZERO feedback that my report actually resulted in a ban, and since the cheating continues, even if they did get banned, so what?  It hasn't improved.What I don't like is ineffective action by the developers.  Regular updates about how many thousands of accounts banned, except that somehow, cheaters have monetized the loot in this game, so for every account that gets banned, another gets purchased, AKA a regular income stream for Blue Hole.  I will continue to play, but in First Person only -- and that does separate me from some of my regular team-mates.  Blue Hole knows what needs to be done, and they have been told LOUD AND CLEAR -- Region Lock China and prevent high pings from playing.  I will continue to play, until FPP gets infected with cheaters, and then I will hang up my headset on this game for good.  I cannot, however, recommend this game in third person -- at all.			"

												""You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.""Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥ing time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat

												Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.

									Product received for freeThis is for the people who brought the starter edition... like me.If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.For the attacking team Sledge - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  Thermite - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.  His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a BIG ♥♥♥♥ING HOLE on reinforced walls.  Though, to create that hole, you have to make sure you stay alive, the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...Thatcher -  Thatcher is your main man.  One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls.  With Thatcher, all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.Ash - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...Twitch - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.And now, for the defending teamRook - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...Bandit - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  Did I also mention he had to deal DRUGS?Jager - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  Smoke - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?Mute - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  Honorable MentionsHibana - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  So do I recommend the game?Absolutely.  Even if you buy the starter edition, all it really means is that it will take more time and patience.  Siege has a huge learning curve but once you get through it, you will be hooked.  I hope this review helped, took me a while but I just wanted to share my thoughts.

												[Description]Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.[Pros]+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release.+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.[Cons]- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.[Conclusion]While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.Enjoyed this review?

												Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018===================================================Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).=====================================Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!============================I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!Update on January 3rd:Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016. We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/) Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.That's it for the January 2018!============================I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!If you want me to answer some questions, feel free to leave a comment.

												A.) I love this game, I have a lot of fun playing this game. I recomond it.B.) My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion. If you are reading this and you wrote a negetive review purly because of this, please take it down now that operation censorship has been cancelled.

												EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.

												My ImpressionIt's hard to write a proper review for this ever-changing, continually evolving game, but at its heart, it will always remain Space Ninjas with Magic... and weapons... tons of weapons.SummaryWarframe easily has enough content to fill up the space of steam reviews..., but let's make it short here:   Positive  Mediocre  Negative    + perfectly executed F2P  ~ misleading store layout       + amazing sidequests  ~ main storyline is very slow        ~ overwhelming content  - subpar new player experience    + different planets  ~ unvaried tilesets      + loveable and hateable characters  ~ some could use more voice lines      + pure fun horde-slaying        + lots of different frames(builds)  ~ some balancing problems      + different build for different mission type philosophy        + have I mentioned tons of weapons?  ~ some are just bad      + diverse mission types          ~ quite a few bugs  - some make you lose mission progress    + tons of things to do  ~ quite repetitive  - lacking endgame    + impressive style and execution        + cool sounds     The GuideSoo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide: Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of itThe Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxyThe Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this gameThe Visuals - the beauty this work of art isThe Sound - and how far you can take itIf that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409926603The VerdictIf you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.NoteIf you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to give this game a try and if you like it, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

												This story requires a bit of setup.Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.

												Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, 1500 hours on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.What is this game evenWarframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe"", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.Whats the bloody goal of the gameUnlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.So hows the customizationThis is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.You can also change the look of your items for maximum fashion, even as a new people.It's free to play, meaning it has microtransactions...Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.Alright, that's good and all, but what are the consEven tho i just said the game is ""extremely replayable"", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a bit beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.Ze EndSo thats my short review of the game. I dont wanna go much more into details since i feel like new players should see it for themself, but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it is, and what you can expect from it. If you like what you hear, then give it a try, its free after all. Now if you will excuse me, i have some Prime items i need to get.

												If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.Now at this stage you're probably saying: ""Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff."" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.1) ""Certain Warframes are OP"" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!2) ""The graphics are horrible"" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.3) ""Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs "" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.Thanks again all!

												First, good things about Warframe:This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.------------------------------------Now, bad things about warframe:-PVP sucks-Grinding, lots of grinding.-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.------------------------------------About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.------------------------------------Final thoughts.Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10*EDIT: Grammar*

												Been playing for 5 years. Might be why I'm still single, but totally worth every second of Grineer grinding, Corpus chopping and Infested popping. My favourite game to date. Totally wrecks any Free-to-play model out there currently, and the Developers actually care about making the players happy with content and great improvements, not just the money.  11/10

												The best 500 hours I've ever spent. Would highly reccomend it. DE has done a fantastic job at taking a mediocre game and transforming it into a content giant with a great community and a satisfying game loop of farming resources and building weapons and new frames. I have met many good friends and made lots of memories in Warframe. And its FREE! Thank you DE for what you have done.Now after I have gushed, I will be real.This game is not for everyone. If grindy games are not for you, I would reccomend you at least try Warframe, but if you get bored and leave I'd understand.I think everyone should at least try this amazing game and experience its dedicated development team and community managers. I give Warframe a near perfect as far as games go. I would say an 8 out of 10 solely for the point that it is still semi-niche as a looter grindy game and that not everything is intuitive and has a decent learning curve.Believe me though,it's worth it.

												upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick ""get in get out"" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going ""I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!"" or reskinned npcs going ""help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!"" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said ""if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club."")the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like ""we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes."" (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!speaking of, & this is really important: most of the quests that give you warframes as rewards are NOT repeatable (& I believe you can't get Octavia's blueprint again if you've already done Octavia's Anthem). if you end up selling a warframe that you got through a quest, as of right now the only way to get it again would be to buy it in the marketplace for platinum.now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game. (which isn't something I'm against, ftr; Digital Extremes is one of the few dev teams out there which I can safely say respects their players and makes sure their game is fun and not just a way to make money.)ultimately, I recommend trying it, especially if you can get some other friends to join you. you're gonna have a good time! and if you ever get stuck, there's a lot of people who can show you the ropes!

				Posted: October 28
												Free to play, free to own. There are microtransactions that keep Grinding Gear Games up and running, but they are only cosmetic and stash related. There is no ""pay to win"". Speaking of winning, there is a new ladder season every 3 months, and ladder characters are automatically transferred to the standard league at the end of the season, so you never lose your characters. Every new ladder season comes with a twist, a special sub-plot that changes every season. The current season's (Sept, Oct, Nov 2018) speciality is called Delve, where you can mine stuff underground and win great rewards.I love this game and highly recommend it.			 
				Posted: December 25, 2016
												This game is not very friendly to casual players, beginners will have a relatively hard time grasping the game's multiple mechanics that have never been in an ARPG previously. However those who put in the time to learn the game's basics will be rewarded with a tremendously addictive game with nearly infinite ways to play. There are many reviews here explaining what the game's features are, but on mine I would like to focus on what a newbie can expect when first playing. I recommend reading this after having read one of the other reviews, that will do a better overview of what the actual game features are.Some of the first struggles a new player will face when first starting this game will be:Learning what is good and what isn't for their character (Many gems/passive traits can be ""noob traps"", such as going full evasion/energy shield gear (without proper understanding of how ES works), or building a full glass cannon character, which is not a good idea (even in a non-hardcore league).Learning to plan their character before even making it. PoE is all about planning, and building your character as you go is rarely a good idea. This is something that players learn over time, and meanwhile a good way to decide what to play is to find a fun skill in-game, and then look up a build for it on the forums (link provided below). Remember that almost anything can work in this game, with proper planning.The economy - PoE's economy is based on trading. There is no universal currency such as gold. There are, in it's place, currency items. Currency items are the items that are used for buying and selling in PoE, but they have an added value in the effects that they can have when used on items. For example: An orb of alchemy can turn a white item (item with no stats), into a rare item with random stats. All the currency in PoE has a different use, and some are rarer than others, adding value to them. I will add a link in my list of links at the end of this review/guide where you can trade items, and trade one currency for another. You can also see the value of each currency there.The gem system. Going back to the subject of ""noob traps"", the gem system has many of them. In PoE, skill gems can level like your character, however there are reasons to consider not leveling them. For example, the ""Cast when damage taken"" gem, which, causes skills linked to it to be automatically casted when you take a specific amount of damage, sometimes should not be leveled, because leveling it increases the amount of damage you need to take in order for the skills to trigger, which can lead to skills not triggering as often as you'd like. Another example is the clarity gem, that gives you a mana regen aura. Leveling it increases the amount of mana reserved, which can be undesirable. It is recommended that you research what changes with each level up for your gems. Leveling gems also increases the level and stat requirement, so if for whatever reason you lose some of an attribute, all of a sudden you will not be able to use that gem anymore until you get more, or, due to the increased level requirement, you will not be able to equip it on another character until they're higher level.The gear system. From mods to sockets, gear in Path of Exile will rarely be equippable as soon as you get it: Those gloves you just got have amazing stats, but the sockets aren't the right color, or aren't linked! Which means you have to craft on them (crafting is the act of spending currency to modify an item, such as linking sockets with orb of fusing). Many times as a new player have I gotten an upgrade, but screwed myself over by spending all my currency trying to craft on it, or on something else, and not ending up with the result I desired, resulting in the item being put in the stash until I had more currency to use on the item. Some management is required.The list will be updated if I am reminded of new things to add to it.All in all, PoE is a great game, one of my favorite games, and once you get into it, you can expect to be playing it for a really long time. The relatively high barrier of entry might intimidate you as a new player, but if you don't mind doing some research of game mechanics, few games will provide the gameplay that PoE provides.

												Most expensive game on Steam.I spent USD 50 *after* playing it for the first time 10 hours straight!Not because I had to. But I wanted to.Many people on steam may think that 10 hours of consecutive gaming is no big deal. But not for me. I’m almost 40. Have a wife, 3 kids, and a demanding job. On any day if I can do 2 hours of uninterrupted gaming, I’m in bliss.POE is that good.I don’t know what took me so long to find this game. I went into this game completely blind. No reviews. No gameplay videos. No guides. It is newbie friendly enough that I could move along the progression. Yet complex enough that I kept wondering what are all these interesting things all around. It makes me feel like a little kid visiting another continent for the first time. Everyone and everything are the same, yet interestingly unique and different.It has the right about of min-max, complexity, and grind. Yet it has flexibility and freedom to truly do whatever I want!So yes. The most expensive game on Steam. Not because I had to. But I wanted to.

												At the time of writing this review I have 2498 hours put into this game. You should consider playing Path of Exile if: 1. You liked Diablo 2, but find Diablo 3 underwhelming and the end game too boring and simple. 2. You like ARPGs3. You like games in which there are several tasks at any time you can spend your time on (crafting, farming, trading, theorycrafting, etc.) 4. You seek a balanced game where there are numerous viable builds and only your creativity with the houndreds and houndreds of items and skill gems limits you. 5. You want to play a game that is constantly updated and balanced with large content additions all the time, including a major expansion every year. 6. You're looking for a game that is truly free to play. All purchasable stuff is cosmetic, with the exception of some quality-of-life upgrades, which are not necessary in order to enjoy and play the game. Path of Exile has a lot more ""depth"" to it than other ARPGs on the market. The skill system, where you can mix-and-match between skill gems; the unique items with special and sometimes build-enabling stats, and the end game map system all contribute to a game that takes something simple and turns it very interesting. Personally, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have played WoW, Diablo, LoL, CS, HS, HotS, SC, and many other games for countless hours, but no game has ever kept me interested for the amount of time that Path of Exile has - it just keeps getting better, and the developers communicate a lot with the community in order to continue to improve the game. BUY IT!!! No, wait, it's free.			 
				Posted: September 4, 2017
												Path of Exile is considered by many to be the true spriritual successor to Diablo 2.  It's dark, gritty and far more complex than its counterpart Diablo 3.  If you're going to play an ARPG, you really should play PoE.Firstly, let's address the burning question:  Is PoE truly Free-To-Play?  Yes.  Absolutely.  There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING, in the game store which will give you or your character an advantage in combat or against bosses or anything that will directly effect your character's stats.  Nothing.  There are two things in the store: cosmetics and some organising-your-inventory perks.  I would argue that the stash tab items are really helpful, but you do not need them.  I was totally F2P for the first 200hrs and had no issues.  All game content is accessible for free.   Pros-The graphics including environments and attack/spell effects are excellent.  The art style is dark.  Think DarkSouls, not WoW.  Also, I use an i7 5820k, 960gtx 4gb and get very steady 120fps.  -The Lore is great and is accompanied by excellent voice acting, generally speaking, across 10 Acts and extensive end-game content.  -The musical score is top-notch and suits each area you travel to and boss you fight.  There is a distinct Witcher 3 inspiration to it especailly in Lioneyes Watch.  You'll know what I mean.  -There are 7 classes to choose from (1 is unlocked later) each with 3 Ascendancies.  -The character tree is HUGE.  It can be quite overwhelming at first but once you get into it, it's not that hard to figure out.  Note the tree works like FFX's sphere grid.  Any character can use any skill and access any node on the tree.  Classes are only limited by where you start on the tree and which Ascendancy you can choose from.  The character building potential options are genuinely staggering. -The amount of loot/items in the game is crazy!  Thankfully, it all has a use and your stash is shared across all characters in a league.  Once you have a feel for the game, it's worth using an item filter.  -No PvP is required to progress in the game which personally, I prefer.  -New temporary leagues with new content/mechanics are run every few months which keeps the game fresh.  There is however a standard league if you are looking for a more permanent set up.  I would however strongly suggest starting in the temporary softcore league as it's more fun.  You can also play in solo mode and have no player interaction should you so choose.    -Though I don't personally suggest following a build straight away as it takes the fun out of it, the game does have a substantial following on Twitch and extensive Wiki to help explain some of the more in-depth mechanics of the game.  -New items are added to the store very regularly and there are also sales on items if you do feel like splashing some cash to make yourself look pretty.    -The game is patched regularly and a realm restart takes place once a week.  The game is usually down for no more than 15-20mins.  Cons-There is currently no in-game auction house.  All item searching is done through a 3rd party website which although functions perfectly well, it requires players to be online to trade with them and you have to do it manually by visiting said person's hideout.  This doesn't ruin the game by any means, but it's something that is seriously lacking considering the amount of loot you acquire and things you want to easily buy/sell.  -There are some weird difficulty spikes here and there.  Though the game generally starts off nice and easy and works it's way up to being very tough in end game, you will come across the odd boss/mob that just seems totally out of place by either being extremely easy or brutally hard.   -If you want PvP, this game is not for you.  It is neither aimed at PvP nor is the game balanced for it.   Path of Exile is by far the best ARPG I have ever played.  Nothing else even comes close to it's depth and replay value.  Whilst the lack of auction house/in-game auto trading is a glaring flaw, it hardly takes away from a superb game.

												One of the best (and true to form) ""Free to Play"" games currerntly available.Positives;~ Monetization is 90% cosmetic, %10 item storage upgrades; Neither of which is an obvious ""Pay to Win"".~ Near limitless replayability with Maps and character building~ Extremely open-ended character building system. You are, in no way, restricted to any particular role or build with each starting class.~ Crafting system is fairly robust.~ Hideouts are a neat little private space and hobby.~ ""Power creep"" does not really kick in until end-game (Maps, lv70+)~ Boss fights are usually fairly well put together and the major attacks are telegraphed.~ The Labyrinth is a neat system for checking one's build and is fun to explore.~ Trade system is especially easy to get involved with. Their ""Public"" tabs automatically load things you place in them to a trade website, without you having to register or post them, yourself. The public market is fairly well established.~ Leagues generally add an interesting mechanic of some sort. Popular mechanics are added to the ""Standard"" league and made a part of the core game.Negatives;~ The program is not the most well optimized and there may be some performance issues, but this seems to be less of a problem as time matches on.~ Hideouts need an item cap higher than 750 items. (This is me nit-picking)So, yeah, I would say that this game is plenty of fun to play and their business model is one of the most generous available.If you are a fan of ARPG games, then give Path of Exile a try. Chances are, you will not be disappointed.			 
				Posted: October 25, 2013
												I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding.  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers.  They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions.  I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon.  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time.Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,  the other large appeal of this game is the end-game.  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content.  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length.  Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers: ""Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items. Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once. Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards. Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level. Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items. For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods.""It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character.  Not all characters are equal.  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa.  Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill.And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'.  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice.All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre.

												TL;DR: this is how you fix a title from an imperfect launch. Good dev response, important features added. Capcom cares.Probably the biggest recovery from launch of any game, ever. Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable. These guys care about making a good game into a great one.			 
				Posted: November 9
												If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!

												Monster Hunter: World is self explanatory. You hunt huge monsters. Let me first mention that I'm new to the Monster Hunter games. I was skeptical when I first bought it. I asked myself, ""Is this any different from Dauntless ?"", and within the first 2 hours of playing I realized it's nowhere compared to Dauntless.Of course, it's not fair compare a free to play game with another game by a very established developer: Capcom. But I thought it would just have the core of what monster hunting should be.I stand corrected. Monster Hunter has surprised me with the other aspects besides hunting, and the mechanics of hunting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind unique game. About 200 hours clocked in as I'm writing this review, yet I'm still not done with this game. Capcom is constantly pushing out new events and new monsters. They listen to the community on how the game can be improved, and they have proved themselves to be developers who care for their players. I'm only comfortable with 1 out the 14 types of weapon in the game, and I am planning to try the other weapons. If you're looking for a co-op where you can literally spend hours playing with your friends, this is the one to go with. It's even more fun with friends.Get this game while its fresh !

												Dont let the mixed overall reviews scare you, the game is very enjoyable in its current state. With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixed, it can only go upwards from here. Also, new content is added every few weeks together with events.Overall the game is a step up from the Monster Hunter series in both graphical terms and gameplay wise.<Comparison to previous MH titles>- Gathering is much easier and faster- More ways to use the environment to your advantage (dropping boulders, sliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)- A slinger which is used primarily for shooting flash bombs, sonic bombs, etc, but can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)- Turf wars between monsters, which can turn the hunt to your favor- Scoutflies which lead you towards points of interest or monster traces (basically they work like a gps)- Usage of armor skills got way easier, you shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MH- Customizable cat companion, with plenty of gadgets to help you out- Damage indicators which let you know if you are attacking a weak spot or just arent doing any damage at all- No G-rank, this is the only downside reallyTL;DR: Game is good, for both newcomers and fans of the MH franchise

												Simply put, if you like the essence of grinding, then, you'll love the game in general. If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.No server issues anymore as well.Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale.

												I first downloaded this game on February 22, 2012. It was my first valve game, my first steam game, and also my first real computer game. I played just about every day. I went from not understanding a thing, to thinking pyro was the strongest, and then figuring out that rocket jumping was a thing. I discovered the community servers button and spent  time playing wacky game modes. Jailbreak, ballon races, slenderman, deathrun, and a lot more. I found out about a map called turbine and found a server close by that ran it 24/7. I played on that server almost every day until the day it closed. I met so many people that I talked to all the time and played some tf2 with. Some of them I still call my closest friends today. I listened to numerous sob stories of several veteran players, about how ""it  was better when I first started playing"", yet they were still playing. I would even try out trading  for profit. That would lead me to the unusual I still treasure to this day. I even tried my hand at non-valve competitive. There I found out the true divide between casual and comp players. I decided I would try to take it more seriously. I led a team that only won one game. (The one game that I wasn't in) I played pugs, watched streams, watched matches, practiced my movement, grinded mge, and still sucked.I remember when valve first added quickplay. I remember the mvm player surge. I rememeber the free to play update. I can remember every single time that people said that made the game worse, yet we kept playing.  I remember the gun mettle update. ""The last good one."" I remember the tough break update. All the hysteria with balance changes. I remember the meet your match update, and how that ""killed tf2."" And finally, I remember the jungle inferno update and how it was a step in the right direction but ultimately underwhelming. But eventually it got to me. There comes a point where you don't put up with the crap any more. Enough was enough. I was put off by tf2 because of how much it was neglected. The lack of valve's communication, their shameful approach to their comp system, how they view community competitive tf2, and eventually my loss of interest.Tf2 would go on to leave a sour after taste in my mouth. I liked playing it, but every time I finished playing it would spiral me further and further down into a pit of desperation. I wanted so badly for others to love tf2 as much as I did, but not even the company responsible for making this game would. It really sucks too. This game is an awesome experience. It deserves more attention. People  need to get passed the fact its old. Non-valve competitive deserves more popularity and should've really taken off as a major e-sport. The community servers deserve more players so more people can experience the true fun experience you get from meeting others. Tf2 is well passed its prime, its golden age, and its time in valve and the public's spolight. That won't change the way I feel about it. I still hope for a resurgence. Call me crazy, but I don't think this game will every truly die. You can take away quick play, release ""better"" games of the same type to compete with it, cast off this game because of its age, but I will never ever give up my hope.This game is so much more deserving of a plain old thumbs up from me. Saying I completely reccommend this game is an understatement. This game is the most incredible multiplayer experience you can have. And it's free! But for now, I think I'll just move on.""Team Fortress 2 is a timeless masterpiece."" ~LazyPurpleThank you so much Team Fortress 2 and Valve for filling my life with an incredible experience that I will carry with me til the day I die.

												A year ago I was playing this game, why? Because a friend recommended it to me, five months later he died for the cancer he had, his mother give me his PC and the next day they went to live somewhere else, since that day I occupy his Steam account and I still play TF2 to remember those moments I played with him, I still think what would happen if he continued to live, playing with me ...I do know but since I started playing TF2 I am happy that a friend who died recommended this to me.i still remember him...

You can either play seriously and wreck n00bs or go around with a sticky jumper and a frying pan and still get MVP.No matter how much I play it never gets old, sure I might play another game for a few hours but I will always come back for more. TF2 forever.

												In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly ten years ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these nine mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience almost every time you play.Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.

												      Well, I've played this game for many years and never wrote a review about it, TF2 is a abusive relationship, it punches the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, but then takes you to dinner. Starting out you know next to nothing, and you get crushed, hard, some classes are easier to start out with than others, namely pyro, soldier, and sniper, heck, even heavy. But still, you will die, a lot, and get dominated, a lot, but eventually things start getting easier, you learn more tricks, feel for the maps, and unlock weapons that help you along the way, outside sources help, guides on how to do things, but those only go so far, and due to changes, might not always be correct, you need to find your own way, get a few people to play with so your salt is slightly less, have fun, and collect hats if you have the disposable income. All in all, TF2 has helped me learn some things about myself, having played for 250+ days of my life it's bound to. If you plan on playing, welcome, this game is far from perfect, but there isn't another one like it.

												I really enjoy a good videogame, but noone else can be compared to TF2 to me. I've been playing this game for a lot of years but i still love it like the first day i installed. In the world of tf2 you can rocket jump through complex maps, kill robots with friends (MVM), playing casual or competitive or just chill in trade servers and a lot more. There's so much to do and a lot of things to learn about this game. All of this and it's free to play... so give it a try!

								This is a review of the offline game.          This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over  25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests.           I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. 	I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. 	After I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought ""oh well"". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. 	I have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.

								Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.I get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.But if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.As a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh, and it's also pretty cheap.

								I have over 200 hours into the game, compared to a lot of ARK players i'm still a noob so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job, don't even bother thinking about getting this game. I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7. First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.Pro tip, don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.2.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) 3.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)4.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1.)6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear, you don't get to save any of your dinos, you don't even get to fight back, it's all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn't tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also, if you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD!10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try, you won't. Look, I'm tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it, not like you'd have a chance if you were.EDIT:I never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.Firstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob, especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe, because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.

													Early Access Review
								Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.  But there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.  Now a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.Then you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave.Months will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.If you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.10/10 Masterpiece.

								First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!This game is like Crack! I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.A few weeks later. we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.One week later. Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. The next day. I log on.Everything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....The chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.RIP.AtlasAbraxisNienTalonAeonMckittenMcCatMcMuffinMike the trikeBob the trikeArmageddonMorgothApocalypse AnkrahmunAnkaderpMuffinDeemDemonspawnSharkenatorLuluRammusRockeyStoneyScorpenatorMittenRappyOmegaMammutanWoollyMamenamenamenanCarnyBrontenatorAnd many more....That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.3 days later. we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. But we we're determined and longing for revenge.... we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.We started mass producing grenades.I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. Today, we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language.

								I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...I'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc.Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.Make no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. For me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team.That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).In all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.

												I am not one to write reviews, positive or negative really about any game I play. But, after playing this game for 8-9k hrs and willingly surviving all manner of bugs, cheats, and trolling, I have found the 1 thing that I think is unnacceptable in any game, which is the ability of other players to completely shut you out of the game. I am currently in someone's base, cuffed to a bed, being fed and watered, and under ACs so I can't even play, move, kill myself or otherwise. Like I said, I have a lot of hrs, so pls don't explain to me how to kill myself in these situations, assume I have tried it all. I am literally losing 0 food or water sitting here online for over a day now. I left my computer on to see what would happen and sure enough, I'm still losing no stats because of this environment. Somehow my character has decided to also stop defecating so there is no way to die at all. I can't even be rescued/killed by my team because I am in a glitched location where the tribe has a giga parked inside biting through walls. While I feel someday the devs might actually listen and ban cheaters/make this form of prolongued capture bannable, atm I am the tribe leader of a tribe that has no ability to play. I am not starting a fresh character and supporting a game that thinks this is gameplay. If you aren't actually playing, it is not gameplay. I am sitting here, not losing a single stat in a survival game, FOR HOURS. Pls fix your game. I have accepted flying dino corpses, ppl undermeshing my base, ppl aimbotting me and my dinos, megatribes, etc... but losing your character like this? its ridiculous

													Early Access ReviewTHIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUESPROS+ Dinosaurs+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)+ Engram System (I really dig it)+ Simple Crafting (It's a no brainer to use and understand)+ Early Access Perks (cosmetic items which are dinky but cool)+ Loot Boxes! + Taming and Mounts (epicness)+ Single Player (has been added!)+ Server Hosting Instructions have been shared+ PvE/PvP commands have been added for server hosting!CONS- Optimization: Needs massive improvement (which is happening! it's a priority with the Devs atm)- Not enough servers to meet the current population- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) - Lag issues across the board. (Some experience it, some do not.)- Raptors (dude, they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)What little I've managed to play I have enjoyed and really look forward to pitching a tent and staying a good long while but I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience either. There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play.I'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.EDIT: 6/2 - Single Player and Hosting Commands have been added by the Devs!THIS IS A DAY 1 REVIEW AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES

												I have been playing this since February and I still come back to it night after night, with close to 2500 hours and still rising.  This game is fun and easily interactive and very immersive.  I'm a 58 year old single woman and this game helps my ability to strategize and socialize and think ahead and most important, it's just plain FUN!!			"

												My ImpressionEverybody probably knows this game by now.But there is way more to it, than big balls and little cars - and that's what makes it so interesting and worth playing for a long, long time.TL;DRBeing quick is an essential part of the game, so let me give you a fast overview:PositiveMediocreNegative+ Fun for beginner, intermediate and pro~ but sometimes very frustrating + Loads of cool mechanics~ take a lot of time to learn + great car and item variety~ a lot has to be unboxed, traded or bought + Great arena designs~ some may lag on older systems + Cool and fresh soundtracks~ some might not like environmental sounds  ~ Manual and Automatic Report/Ban features - toxic community+ regular huge, awesome and free updates The GuideI will put the main part of this review into a steam guide, the foremost reason is, that there is far too much I want to talk about.To justify making it a guide-review, I will put a lot of reference to it and go into more detail, so I hope you can accept my decision and enjoy it regardless.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947564753The VerdictThe game is designed to be pure fun for everybody and it achieves this goal with flying marks.A definite recommendation for just about anyone coming by, trust me that you can have fun without investing a ton of time.Just mind that it's a big online game and like any other of the size, it attracts trolls, plain idiots and other sorts of human scum, so do yourself a favor and disable voice and maybe text chat in the options and you are good to go.NoteIf you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

												When you buy this game, it will take about 20-30 hours to actually start hitting balls. By 100-150 hours, you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then, that's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more, until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes, this game is higly addictive. My favorite game ever without any doubts.

												Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. Best.Game.Ever.

												So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?- Great gameplay- Marvelous graphics- Very competitive- Alright singleplayer- Tons of customization- Easy to pick up, hard to master- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)- Cross-platform+ Much more to experience for yourself!Cons:- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.''Just one more game'' - everyone.

												Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie - You can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still♥♥♥♥♥♥Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag. But if you didn't, still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.EDIT - 2/13/2016: You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games... ty for the read

												Please bring back casual rumble!- In comp, there is so much hate. They hate me when I do a mistake. They hate me when they do a mistake. They hate me when I touch the ball. They hate me when I don't touch the ball. They hate me when the opponents have three plungers and I got the tornado. - In casual, they usually just spammed what a save, slammed their controller in the wall and left the game. Then they got replaced by a lovely bot named Squall, who never complained about anything. He just kept fighting. I love Squall. Squall also wants casual rumble back.

												Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479653619			"

												This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of ""one more turn"" could not be more applicable.You can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.There are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. This game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.

												Love this game, I bought it for my grandpa originally and he played it non stop til he passed away. I believe he had around 600+ hours on it. So from a 66 year old to a now 17 year old collectively enjoy this game.This was the account i set up for him also but then he gave me the computer in his will and i kept it going.

												This is a warning. This game is too much fun and should not be played before you go to bed. There have been times where my friends or I think we have only played for 1 hour and only look at the clock only to realise we have played for over 8 hours and it is 4am in the morning. Should you get this game?Yes.Will this game mess with your sense of time?Yes it will.

												You shouldn't tolerate the new launcher.This is setting a standard that flies in the face of a full release pay-to-play game, keep your adverts for f2play freemium titles or not at all.I'll remove this review if they make any meaningful change to this situation.To get rid of the new launcher see below:*FIX*For people who the new launcher doesn't work for, or who just don't want to have to load adverts every time they launch their game, you can revert the the old CIV 5 launcher using the following steps:    Open up Steam and navigate to your LIBRARY.    Right click on the game in your library and choose ""Properties.""    Selected the ""BETAS"" tab.    In the text box to ""Enter beta access for to unlock private beta:"" enter the password ""ineedlegacyaccess"".    Click on the ""CHECK CODE"" button.    You should see a confirmation message that access has been granted.    If not already selected in the drop down, select ""legacy"" and click close.    Steam may require you to download and update for the game. Wait for this to happen or force it using ""LIBRARY -> DOWNLOADS"".    Once the game has been updated, click ""PLAY"" as usual and you will be running the legacy branch.Credit:  u/pedal_pusher

												50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington.you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar.Then you will take out Washington because he is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long.Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win!But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, ""what is this!?"" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state.The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts ""WAR"" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation.You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the  humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding.You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and  your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it?Ghandi is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10

												You'll keep telling yourself, ""Just one more turn,"" or ""I can't get off while I'm at war,"" and then suddenly you'll realize it's four in the morning, you haven't written that paper for college, you have class in four hours, and you haven't slept at all. 10/10. Would recommend for that procrastinator in your life.

												tl;dr: Just play Civ V instead.Well, I've been trying to love this game for 642 hours now (as opposed to 3532 hours wasted/enjoyed in Civ V). Some observations about this game as it stands alone, now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way: - AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage, attack when it has the advantage, or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop, as in a real-life war. Nope. Scattered, random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1-2 infantry or cavalry units, plus 1 artillery. - Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor, as one does in war, you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval, consuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things, it seems to be an either/or, all-or-nothing, hair-trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next, because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance, spectrum, or ""scoring"" to this system, as far as I can tell, contrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced."" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off. - Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly, you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses. - The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7-5930k and an i7-6850k, and on both, it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing, or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn, I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time, without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat. - The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game, I really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be made, and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders, but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology, like a ""self-reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking, while removing late game tedium. - The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads; military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages, no, it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game. - I like the districts mechanic in principle, but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost, or at the VERY least, there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial, commercial, or theater district in the future, before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders, each of which have strict, arbitrary requirements.) At the very least, there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile. - Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter. - Personally, I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraft, as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks, like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also, by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power, you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless, and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now. - Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game, since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer, but at the same time, you've got to ask, of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units, it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess, if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory, you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories, initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill. - In my experience, all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable), you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic, but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x, varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish. - City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state, or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked, and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city, all your units are immediately expelled from that territory, bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible. - So tired of hearing ""best not to aid that city state"" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one??? - The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat, but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700, or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger), miss a lot of the boosts, and discover petroleum in 1960.I fired up this game this morning on a sick day to pass the time, and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game. That should tell you something.

												Hi,I wouldn't normally right a negative review about any game, but I feel this is important. Anyone living in EU who value their privacy should stay away from buying any future content from take 2 interactive until they remove that horrendous paragraph from their EULA where you give consent to let this company share your details with whoever the hell they want  without regards to how these 3rd parties use your data.

												I'll preface by admitting that I'm a grumpy old civ4 elitist, but this game just isn't worth buying in its current state.There are a lot of very cool systems the designers have put up a rough foundation for, but it's still just too empty to really enjoy.  You can really see the potential in this game, but there's still just so many little things missing or buggy that drive you nuts.And as always, the AI is dumb as rocks.  They keep making the combat engine more and more complicated without adapting the AI to handle it at all.  As a result, you can win wars with maybe 4-5 units.  The AI is just not good enough to handle the system.  All the depth of the combat mechanics just aren't satisfying because of this.  It's like beating a dog in Chess.  Your great strategy and tactics are simply wasted on an opponent that has no idea what it's doing.And a full year after release, there are still missing hotkeys for actions you will do *EVERY TURN*.  The art is gorgeous.  The soundtrack is amazing.  The district system and the armies/fleets system show so much promise.  But the game's just not deep enough, and the AI so poor that it's simply not enjoyable after one or two playthroughs.  I cranked the difficulty up to diety on my 2nd playthrough, and still got bored and quit 200 turns in because of how far ahead of the AI I was.  I played on Emperor in civ5, and I think Monarch in civ4.  It's not like I've magically gotten better at the game.  The AI is just *that* bad.  It is utterly incapable of threatening you militarily, and does not know how to pursue win conditions at all.Again, there's a TON of potential.  Really disappointing game as it stands though.  Maybe with a couple of expansions it'll reach its full potential, but until then I cannot recommend this game.

												After putting in about 1500 hours at the time of writing this, I think it's safe to say I can write a somehwat informed review (because I have opinions and I like to share them, that's why). I'm no veteran Civ player, I've only played 5 and 6, though I'm aware that 3 and 4 are still good games. However, even coming from 5 which had it's own disappointing launch, 6 is a massive drop in depth and quality. No matter how hard I try, I cannot lose myself in this game the way I did in 5. I'm never on edge, wondering what will happen next, because I know what'll happen next. War. War for settling wrong. War for being the wrong religion. War for governing wrong. War for being too strong and too week (at the same time). War for not trading. War for simply existing in a manner that doesn't quite suit somebody else. What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with ""agendas"", results in predictable games where everyone hates you, or everyone loves you (until they don't). There's never a middle ground.On agendas, certain civs simply don't play themselves as they should. Hey Brazil, I see you've denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you. Would you like to change that? Maybe build a campus or theater square? No? Just gonna build another encampment? Thought so. Nice to meet you China. No I didn't realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world. Do you know why? It's because you never built one China, that's why. Ah, Cleopatra, I see you're now chronically indecisive, as you simultaneously hate and love large militaries, and simply can't make your mind up. These agendas will override everything else you do with/to another civ. If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continent, you might be inclined to pitch in on good ol' America's behalf. But more fool you, because you see, America hates people who declare war on his neighbours, even if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash. A man's got to have a code after all. Now you're a warmonger. Why? Good question, but it's ok, Alexander the Great still loves you.The next part of my rant jamboree is the design of the game, such as unit scaling and modelling and such. Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a ""mobile game"" aesthetic, justly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously. Thankfully, the gameplay hasn't been dumbed down, so much as screwed up (see agendas). I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards me, because I'm too distracted by the trader, whose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace. In Civ 5, when the Mongol horde was at my borders, it stretched on and on like, well, a horde. Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all together, each being roughly the size of an entire building, and altogether looking rather silly. If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol horde, or anyone else's horde for that matter. The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitude.The AI in Civ 6 cannot war, which is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war. Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to man, but rest assured, it'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following; ranged units + garrion promotion, place in city centres and encampments. Or just wait them out, when you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate life, or throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support. It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planes, so I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soon.I will now try to think of some nice things to say about Civ 6. You can use mods in multiplayer games fairly easily. See that overpowered civ from your favorite TV show that was obviously made by a fan with no thought to game balance? Yup, you can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence. The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friends, where the only real competition in science, culture, faith and of course, war, are the other human players. The AI might aswell be so many other city states. Oh and the music. While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic. Entering the industrial era to ""Scotland the Brave"" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfying, to say the least. But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the map, and that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this one, and that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning. And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself. And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion mods.(oh yeah and districts aren't that special, I always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)(I'll stop typing now I am very tired)EDIT:I have so many hours played in this game because of friends who used to enjoy playing it. As they lost interest, I lost interest. There were other mods I used that also made it fun, which are no longer usable since the summer patch (I think, it might have been the spring one I can't remember). I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should. Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release. Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchise, I don't know. Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game. That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have played, or whether or not I ""got my money's worth"".(While I understand where some people are coming from with the ""you played a bunch but didn't like it so why did you play it"" mentality, I would not take any review seriously with few hours played, regardless of wether they reccomended it or not. If my friends came with the game in a sort of package deal, then sure I'd reccomend it, but I got them elsewhere)

								As most steam users will do, they underestimate how fun a ""free"" game can be.When I first saw Ring of Elysium, I thought the name was cheesy, and the addition of snow sports and ziplines and paragliding in a battle royale game was nonsense. How could something so ridiculous be incorporated into a game like this?And then a couple of my friends started playing it, and had recommended it to me. I thought, ""you know what, let's give it a shot""I load up the game, immediately the main menu music caught my attention. Although it is quite common for games to have a great menu screen, i was completely caught off guard because of the free game. I jump into a match and realise that this game is quite fun! It is unlike most battle royales you may or may not have played. Instead of jumping out of a plane or bus, you start somewhere on the map by picking your location during the preparation phase. The combat is rewarding and satisfying, with the hitmarkers being the cream on top. Ziplines, snowboarding and paragliding add major parts into your experience, changing the way you strategise your exploration as you make your way closer into the zone, fleeing from the severe snow storm Ymir.  The addition of being able to equip two scopes is really helpful as well, allowing for both CQC and long range snipes with opposing players. To win, you must survive till the final zone, and must wait for an evacuation helicopter to help you escape Ymir. The helicopter can take up to 4 players, and once you're inside, you've secured the victory, whether for yourself, or your squadmates. Not all party members need to make it up to the helicopter and it will stay there until either the helicopter is full or everyone is dead. Players will duel it out in the final zone to make it into the helicopter but they will need to be swift, as the storm will become increasingly more cold, dealing more and more damage as time goes on.If you're a fan of PUBG, but want a more freedom in your mobility and a change in playstyle with a smaller and much different environment while still maintaining that 'battle royale' feel, Ring of Elysium is definitely a game to try out.We need OCE Servers. We only have AS and NA Servers at the moment. :(

													Early Access ReviewA Surprisingly GOOD Free-To-Play Alternative to PUBGhttps://youtu.be/vvZV98d1QLg+ Instead of it being Last man Standing, a helicoper comes at the end and up to 4 players can climb the ladder to ""win"" the game. This adds another level of strategy, as people fight to get a spot on the chopper. + Snowboarding and Hang Gliding offers quick ways to travel across the map+ Plenty of time to escape the ""death barrier"" which is a snow storm that pushes in.+ Plenty of vehicles and new ways of transport like using a network of ski lifts+ Unlike PUBG, you get a backpack at the start, and there's PLENTY of loot so you don't have to waste so much time looking for gear.+ Good variety of weapons+ At the time of writing this, there are no microtransactions.- The beginning of each round you pick a ""spawn point"" and instantly spawn at the plot. You also get to see other players spawn choices making it easy to tell exactly where people are at the start. - Not the best netcode / bullet mechanics. - Terrible area-sound effects...you can't tell where bullets are coming from or how far away someone might be. Someone in a different house may sound like he's in the same house as you.If you like PUBG you will most likely enjoy Ring of Elysium.

								This game is truely a gem among stones. I began playing this after it popped up on my recommended list. It's free, so I figured why not? The best way to describe this game is as somewhere between PUBG and Battlefield. What makes it different? Unlike literally every other BR game, there's no circle that slowly creeps up on you. There is a storm, affectionately named ""Ymir"", that pushes the players closer and closer towards a randomly selected area of the map. However, the storm is on a countdown and will immediately move into, and begin causing damage to players in, the selected areas. You chose one of 3 classes to spawn in as when you begin each round. The Glider, Snowboard, or Climbing Pack. Each has different abilities and weight capacities that provide both advantages and disadvantages on the battlefield.  There is no Plane/PartyBus. You select where you want to spawn at the beginning of the match, and you are also able to see where everyone else spawns. The locations are split up on a grid, and there is only one player (or team) allowed per square.  When the end of the match is near, a helicopter will swoop in and you must climb the ladder (without getting shot off) and climb into the helicopter to secure your victory. 4 players from any combination of teams can escape and win the match. If only one of your squadmates escapes, it counts as a victory for the whole squad. This game also has much faster matches. Instead of the 100 players you'll find in PUBG or FNBR, ROE only has 50 or 60 (can't remember which) players per match, and the matches tend to go significantly faster than other BR games. Some negatives I've come across in my time playing: Hit registry can sometimes be funky. I have a video of myself sniping a guy in the bum and somehow getting a headshot.   But most of the time I have no quarrels.  Weapons are not very balanced. She sniper rifles (Particularly the Remington 500) feel very underwhelming, and An M4A1 with all attachments is better than any other assault rifle overall handsdown. If two players of the same skill level faced off with even odds, but one had an M4 and the other had any other assault rifle, the M4 guy WILL win. But in general all the weapons are usable and there's quite a vareity.  People complain a lot about hackers, I've only had one or two questionable experiences in my 200+ games, but I don't doubt they're out there. The devs seem to be taking the concerns quite seriously and I have faith they are doing their best.  End-game is usually predictable. Once Ymir hits in the final stages, people just play the waiting game and usually who ever has the most meds will end up winning.

								Now right off the bat, I'm going to say that this is by far my favorite battle royale and 100% deserves a try, it was fun, fast-paced gameplay, interesting mechanics and... Lore? now here are the pros and cons:Pros:* Fast paced, fun and tactical gameplay* Unlike other battle royales (which I find get dry after extensive gameplay) this has fast load times and no pre-game lobby BS that feels like a lifetime and a half to get through and then into the game* Is polished really well considering how new it is (definitely better than PUBG was)* New mechanics that freshen up the genre something that really hasn't been done in a while* A great time whether you are playing with or without friends (i personally prefer to play with friends)* The servers are amazing and I haven't encountered any problem with them so far* Free to playCons:* The game is a little glitchy at times which can get frustrating but keep in mind it is in early access and all of this is subject to change and it likely will because this game gets updated quite frequently with frequent patches to most of the bugs discovered by the community* It is a little frustrating that I cannot find anyone on the Asian servers or the North American servers that speak English* The bullet drop is hard to figure out but I assume that I will come to learn it with time* There are microtransactions

								First, let me clear the air around the malware accusations. I HAVE ANALYSED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE GAME. Based on that, this is what I have found evidence to support:What the game does do: scans the binary data of programmes that are running, as well as any libraries or scripts those programmes have loaded. This is likely a function of the Tencent Protect anti cheat system.What the game does NOT do: touch or read any personal information from any location on the disk that isn't related to the game.With that out of the way, this is an extremely fun game. It's early access, which means it's beta at best, and as a result, has a fair bit of bugs. That's fine. It takes a very different approach from PUBG and Fortnite BR, which are its two main competitors. You select a spawn location on the map (and no other player can choose the same square as you unless you're in a squad with them), and then you spawn on the ground. You start with a basic weapon, depending on your kit, and the three kits each have different methods for getting around - as well as drawbacks specific to those kits. Finally, up to four DIFFERENT TEAMS can win the game - and you can win without a single kill.The hit registration is not the best, nor is the meshing of objects, so firing around objects doesn't always work. The spectation system has some issues, so when someone is shooting, it appears that they're completely missing, whereas their shots hit and it's legitimate. There are account suspensions going around for legitimate players who are just good, and they get suspended just for being very good. This is something that's annoying, but I don't expect it to be a problem forever.So, here's the breakdown: Does the game have issues? Yes.Is it still extremely fun? Yes.Do I recommend it? Yes.Happy hunting!

												I started off as a bird species on the far edge of the galaxy. Their average lifespan was around 60 years, but they made every year count. They were obsessed with technology, already building their first robots before they had even left their world. Unfortunately, they were immediately boxed in by empires that had emerged into FTL travel far before they had. Their dreams of expanding into distant worlds was immediately and brutally crushed, after their first colony was bombarded into oblivion during in an ill-fated first-contact. Instead of expanding into planets, my people instead built habitats around dead worlds, watching with envious eyes as their hyper-religious neighbours claimed lush, verdant planets. They waiting, watching their old sicken and die, wracked by disease and genetic weakness, while the incredibly long-lived religious neighbours often made it to ages such as 110. Their neigbours scoffed, those Emperors of the Divine. They knew those foolishly materialistic birds could not possibly understand their true purpose in the unvierse. God was on the side of those who hated materialists, after all. Humiliation after humilitation followed, where my people were used in foreign wars, had their new colonies taken away from them, brave colonists literally eaten as delicacies in certain worlds. The bird's hearts gradually hardened, and they began to view aliens with the contempt they so richly deserved. The hatred grew, and the people grew stronger from it. One day, a neighbouring empire, a race of disgusting fungoids, had their fleet annihilated in a short-lived war with an impossibly-powerful ancient empire. Quickly taking advantage of their weakened status, my people quickly turned them into tributaries. The bounty of materials allowed a new phase of expansion for my people, and we colonized 3 new planets. Suddenly, they had become a Great Power in their local area. The religious kings nearby, now the undisputed superpower of the galaxy, continued to ignore them. After all, they were but a gnat in comparison to the territorial holdings of the great Empire. They were soon proven wrong, as in a few short years a massive construction of habitats was implemented across my people's nation. Billions of souls now rested in space, enough to even match the population and might of the Divine Empire. My people continued to advance, their knowledge of cybernetics second to none. Soon, they had a breakthrough: implants could increase their efficiency to the point where they would become the superpower. After a brief teething period, it was done. Every man, woman and child was equipped with the implants. The Divine Empire was horrified, quickly declaring an unprovoked war. But this was not the same bird people as before. Now, their vengeance was at hand. They crushed the forces of the False Emperor, casting him down, and taking his holdings for themselves. The long-lived creatures were quickly enslaved, forced to watch their once great empire collpasing into feuding chiefdoms. Soon, the bird race began to challenge even the ancient empires, building Ringworlds, Dyson Spheres, and even an sensory array that let them see the entire galaxy. Furthermore, they discovered a way to store their minds into an immortal body of steel. This would not stand, the ancient empires decided, immediately declaring war on the innocent birds. Once again, they were quickly crushed, thousand-year old empires grinded into the dust of history. Now, there were only the birds, mechanical gods of the galaxy, encased in empty, undying shells. Every other race was dead, killed in revenge for their cruelty, and their arrogance. A foreign invader came, a biological hivemind from another galaxy. They too, were quickly crushed, and their worlds burned into ashes. The gods built a ringworld at the centre of the galaxy, to remind those fledgling races, just coming into space travel, of the folly of those who came before, then retreated back the edge of the galaxy, content to explore the mysteries of the universe within their massive ringworlds. Time would only tell if the newer races will make the same mistake. tl;dr: Get this game, the stories you create will make you addicted. Please send help.

												I decided that my first Stellaris playthough would be on Ironman mode, with no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever. What follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years.Background:I named my empire ""The Galactic Empire"" and began the game as a militarist, materialist, and authoritarian.The Celimy Conflict:Early on, around the 50 year mark, I encounter a species of strange, fungal creatures. They call themselves the ""Celimy States"". They are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists. Fools.After a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry, the Celimy declare war on me.My navy, christened the ""Grand Imperial Navy"", departs the Coruscant System to engage the Celimy ""Mycelium Carriers"", as they called themselves.A short time later, the Imperial Navy reaches the Celimy home system. Imperial transports land armies on their capital.The takeover is rapid, and at the end of the war the Celimy States has splintered into 3 separate nations: The Celimy Hegemony, the Celimy Confederacy and the Celimy Associates. Later on, the Associates would become my vassal. The Confederacy was a long standing enemy.The Galactic Civil War:Around 120 years in, the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires, and two distinct sides begin to form.On one side is myself and a federation called the ""Stellar Entente"", along with various other small empires.The other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations, led by the ""Karabnar Nations"".War breaks out, with the Karabnar declaring war on the Galactic Empire.I now have 3 fleets: The Star Corps, the Shock Battalion, and the Grand Imperial Navy. The Star Corps and Shock Battalion are relatively small shock forces, whereas the Grand Imperial Navy is my main force.A massive space battle in the Ocheron system involves over 1000 ships, with almost every known nation being present.The battle (which was beautiful to watch) was relatively even until the arrival of the Star Corps and Shock Battalion, who tipped the balance with fresh ships.The combined fleet of myself and my allies (yes, the AI is THAT good) eventually reaches Karab, the Karabnar Nations capital, and takes the system with the help of two Titanic Beasts recruited from the outer systems of the Empire.On the verge of victory, I am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over Coruscant. Sent by the Hjaarthi Syndicate, one of our enemies, the fleet is in position to take our homeworld. My own fleets cannot reach Coruscant in time. All seems lost.A mere few days before Coruscant's fortifications would've failed, a fleet from one of my allies, the Verulian Compact, comes out of hyperspace above Coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet.The Karabnar Nation and their allies surrender, and the war is won.The Fallen Empire (150 years in):A fallen empire (which is a fully developed but stagnant state) exists above me. They call themselves the Yz'Vorak Remnant (which I shortened to Y Remnant).They are military isolationists, and hate my empire with a special intensity.They insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire. This sort of war is usually a death sentence, so I move large numbers of people away from the Frontier and prepare to submit.At this point I've got 3 vassals. All are weak, but they are extremely loyal. The vassals join me in the war.All 3 of my fleets meet above Coruscant, along with Transports for my Droid Army (Irony, much)I deploy my entire military to the Jahab system, where we meet the Fallen Empire's forces.Their ships are unlike anything we've ever seen, and are incredibly powerful. We are losing the battle. Things are not looking good.Suddenly, out of hyperspace, come 3 fleets; my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort. With their help, we drive back the Fallen Empire forces.Fastforward about 3 years.Through intense naval strategy and economic strain, Imperial forces have out matched the Y Remnant's fleet. The Grand Imperial Navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital: The Core.I don't have enough strength left to invade their planets, so I offer them a white peace.Fallen Empires cannot build new fleets, so this seemed logical enough.I recieve a notification:""Peace Accords on Coruscant""While signing the peace accords on Coruscant, two V Remnant agents who were standing next to the Emperor (of the Galactic Empire) killed him and mutilated his body.Furious, the Imperial Navy and the combined fleets of all of the Empire's vassals and allies immediately attack the Y Remnant Capital.Out of nowhere, a massive army from the Fallen Empire comes out of hyperspace over The Core (I still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from).In the epic battle that ensues, the Grand Imperial Navy defeats and destroys the Y Remnant's fleet, allowing the ground invasion of The Core to take place.With The Core fallen, the Fallen Empire cowers and begs for peace.The Y Remnant is annexed by the Galactic Empire.Peace reigns across the galaxy.Around 20 years later...Subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before. A new being from out of our dimension makes contact. Their signal is not unlike a hunting call.....BY POPULAR REQUEST, AN UPDATE:Their name is the Unbidden and they make an immediate point.A transmission appears on my screen, depicting some kind of strange, ethereal being.They say something about prey and then the transmission cuts out.The Unbidden fleet is marked by science ship in the bottom part of the galaxy, below myself and the ""Qix'Lufran Combine"".The Qix'Lufran are isolationist authoritarians, but decide to deploy their entire fleet, the sole largest fleet in the galaxy, to immediately engage this extraterrestrial threat.The Qix'Lufran fleet reaches the Unbidden's position, and is utterly destroyed.This shocks the entire galaxy.Interestingly enough, these ""Unbidden"" would remain effectively dormant in their small region at the bottom of the galaxy. Not sure if it was because of the Fallen Empire bordering them, or simply because they were waiting for reinforcements. Either way, the Unbidden hold their position for the time being.The Great Intergalactic War:The Galactic Empire has become the most powerful and largest state in the galaxy. Above us, the ""Hjannarthi Syndicate"" exists, which nearly equals my own power. To our left is the ""Stellar Entente"" federation. To the right is the Njalax High Kingdom, and the Uriy Republic. Below us, the Zuifvan Imperium, the Qix'Lufran, and the Unbidden.Although there is a period of peace, there is great unrest in the galaxy.The Qix'Lufran and Njalax grow closer and closer every year.Eventually, they declare a defensive pact and close their borders to myself, the Stellar Entente and the Hjannarthi Syndicate.Their combined power rivals my own; they are dangerous.They undergo a combined massive military buildup, and begin to become increasingly aggressive.In mid july of 2412 (212 years in) the tensions boil over. The Njalax and the Qix'Lufran declare war on the Galactic Empire, the Hjannarthi, and the Stellar Entente. The galaxy is divided.A line is drawn essentially down the middle of the galaxy, dividing the left(Qix'Lufran and Njalax) from the right(Galactic Empire and Allies).I issue an immediate order to deploy the fleet. The long dormant Grand Imperial Navy assembles over Coruscant.Admiral Cognat leads the navy.My ever-reliable vassals send everything they have to join the Imperial Navy. I love those guys.The Stellar Entente's federation fleet strikes first. They use their wormhole stations to attack directly at the heart of the Njalax.My own fleet reaches the Qix'Lufran capital with relative ease, meeting almost no resistance.We confront a vastly outmatched Qix'Lufran force of 2 battleships and 18 corvettes.

												Stellaris is a game about ruling a galactic empire. You get as much out as you put in. Most of the negative reviews disparage the game's shallowness or how it misses the mark while getting close, or it isnt really a very deep game, and many of the mechanics can simply be ignored. These things are partially true. It's a nice selling point to say your empire has factions and you will need to manage them, but you don't actually. You can do fine by completely ignoring factions. The game likes to say it features complex trade and diplomacy, but in reality you can largely ignore your neighbors unless they don't like you, and if that is the case you can simply try to maintain parity or conquer them if they get weak. Many of the mechanics are like this, largely shallow through the most objective lenses. However, is it still one of my favorite games because of the way I play it. This may sound weird, but try playing the game without the goal to win, but instead as a Roleplaying game. Do you want to be the isolationist focused exclusively on inward development? The Sprawling galactic empire everyone must kneel to or face their wrath? The tiny empire consisting of only a few planets, but ridiculously efficent and strong on defense? You can be nearly any type of empire you can imagine. You can also play as nearly any scifi empire you know of. Wanna be the Borg? The Centauri? The Goa'uld? The damn Necromongers? You can create it. I play Stellaris to relax, and roleplay, not to win. I had over 200 hours before I won my first game.The mod community is extremely dedicated and dowloading a fresh slew of mods is one of the things that keeps me coming back. There are some seriously passionate modders working on this game, and many of their ideas get adapted into regular major game updates by the devs, who are constantly working to improve the game. The game is not without its frustrations. Once the map has filled in and nothing is left to explore it can be really frustrating if you get boxed in by powerful neighbors, some mods can help with this. You can sometimes get completely annihilated by the endgame crisis simply because you focused in the wrong type of weaponry. The crisis can also start in your empire and ruin you or on the other side of the galaxy so you never evern get to participate, or worse it grows too strong for you to deal with once it consumes your neighbors. Getting attacked or ganged up on by the good guys because your despotic empire got unlucky and your neighbors formed a federation against you alone, there are others, but even still I love this game.This review is kind of a rant, but it is difficult for me to write a really objective review. Take the negative reviews seriously. Some of the issues they bring up are totally justified, but also realize that not every game is for everyone, and if thie game looks appealing to you, it just might be one of your favorites too.

												I'm no professional reviewer. I'm not even a professional Stellaris player (if such a thing exists.) I love space, I love strategy and I love killing dirty filthy xenos. Stellaris is a game about finding new planets, colonizing alien worlds and getting into bad, Sad (!) trade deals. Potentially the worst trade deals in strategy game history. There are many things I would call Stellaris: Good. Bad. Xeno Annhilation Simulator. But overall this game sucked over 560 hours of my life into it before I uninstalled it. As of today, December 10th, 2017, Stellaris is no longer installed, but I am writing a review for it. Why? I love the game, but I also hate the game. During my first playthrough, I lost in the first 100 years. I was a poorly created nation that I thought would've been fun. This is the reason why it's easy to lose sometimes. There are definitely better Empires that can be created and are usually the ""fun"" empires to play. While there are offshoots, such as the One Planet Challenge and Inwards Perfection, it's mostly the same monotonous empire type, but that can't stop more roleplaying capabilities. That is a lot of the fun when it comes to Stellaris, is working around a relatively constricted system and making it yours. With mods at your side and a customizable Galaxy, almost any science-fiction empire, coalition, alliance or federation can be played. While the game isn't completely unplayable with mods, there is a reason why I have almost no achievements in Stellaris -- mods disable achievements. I don't have the greatest PC in the world. It's quite bad actually. After first the 50 years the game starts to slow down, and by the time the massive deathball fleets start slugging it out, it feels like it takes 50 years for the battle to end. Looking at discussions and other player's comments, Stellaris does have issues with performance when it comes to the later years. The difference here is that while my bad PC starts chugging after 50-70 years, better PC's can start chugging after a mere 100 - 150 years, which just by glancing at screenshots and discussions, a lot of players like to go into the 200 and 300 year long campaigns. The longest campaign I've seen went into the 2700's, and the game starts in 2200. Combat is negligable. It's a matter of who has the largest fleet in the game and comes down to one battle and then becomes either you building up a fleet to take back your captured planets to keep your warscore afloat or moving from planet to planet pumping your warscore up. Although it can be made more interesting, say with friends you intentionally don't have any fleets over 50K fleet power, you can have such a skirmish-based war, but in most conventional wars there is nothing like this. In the upcoming 2.0 update, there are changes coming to this, the idea of a death stack fleet is going to be hard to take away. Colonizing becomes less of an effort and more of an off-hand thing after the first 30-ish years. You look closely at your colonies and make sure that their needs are tended to for your first five or so colonies. Afterwards it becomes more of a template system applied over planets and using them to produce more ships and armies to conquer more smaller empires and take their planets or make them fight for you. Exploration is one of the funnest aspects of the Stellaris early game. Getting anomalies, finding new Empires, figuring out who your rivals are, figuring out who your friends are and having your sciENTIST DIE AGAIN BECAUSE OF A FAILED 5% ANOMALY. But this early game is also the most dangerous. Your beginning fleet can be destroyed by the wrong jump into a system with a Leviathan. You can lose your entire science ship fleet in one year. Some slightly larger empire can have a fleet twice the size of yours. Some slightly smaller empire can have a fleet half your size and suddenly look conquerable. Drawing your borders and finding your mid-game is one of the best parts of the game. The mid-game is when it starts to fall apart and Paradox tries to fix a hole in a tanker with scotch tape. The game starts to slow down. The anomalies start disappearing. The special projects are being researched. The fleets are staring each other down and waiting to fight. Colonies start becoming self-sufficient, and half your colonies are in sectors anyways. While the game starts picking up in diplomacy and war in these parts, the diplomacy is mediocre to say the most and I've already covered the combat. Diplomacy boils down to rivaling your to-be friend's rivals, and sending them some minerals, food and energy monthly for nothing. You then send a non-aggression pact and then a defensive pact. Don't get me started on how the AI declares wars either. During the late game, things become interesting again. 150-200 years into the game, the legendary and scary Crises start popping up. Everything from the Robotic Contingency, to the interstellar Prethorean Scourge and the devastating Unbidden and their kin. While not exactly an end-game crisis, the War In Heaven divides the galaxy and introduces the galactic powerhouses of the Awakened Empires. All of these breathe new life into the game again, and can be the key to winning the game in a matter of years or fighting a losing war over the course of decades. Overall, Stellaris is good and bad. I love it so much, otherwise I wouldn't have spent 564 hours on it. I befriended Xenos and I annihilated them. I conquered the galaxy and I helped the galaxy. I lost the game in 10 years and I won the game in 200. I love this game and I hate this game. It's still rough around the edges but is definitely a diamond in the rough. It's a game that, like most Paradox games, still need a couple years before it becomes one of the definitive games in the space 4x genre. I recommend it, but play it later. It still needs a little bit of time to mature.

												I`m 313 hours into Stellaris.  I haven´t completed it, but I believe I can give a pretty good impression of the game.This review includes ALL the DLCs, up to and including Utopia.Stellaris is one of those unique games where random♥♥♥♥♥♥happens so often that one game can feel like several new playthroughs. Over 300 hours into the game, I still often find brand new things happening  in single player and multiplayer modes.You start with a single planet and a few people.  From there, you go off to take over the universe. You will encounter everything from space dragons, horrors of the void and pirates that will try to kill you. For that matter, half of the universe will also attempt to kill or devour you. The rest wanna make friends or simply breed you out of history.Going into Stellaris, it is important to know that this is NOT a game you will finish in a day or a week.  It's a game where you should take your time and really learn and understand what is going on. It´s a game where every choice you make for your population affects the outcome of the game.Reasearch, building, military and social aspects of your population are by your command. There are a million tools to reach your goal, so you get to pick whatever you want.You wanna be a insane warmonger ? Sure, go ahead, You wanna be a spiritual leader who believes in peace ? Sure, go ahead. You wanna be the most tech-savvy scientist and have every population below you ? Sure, go ahead.You wish to enslave the entire world and feel like a king with slaves ? Sure, go ahead.You wanna be a complete asshat and purge people who disagree with you ? Sure, go ahead.Stellaris lets you truly customize according to your whims and rule the universe as you like, which is great.Design your own race, from appearance to values.Design your own ships, with weapons, shields, and FTL drives.Design your own planets with terraforming and much more.Gameplay and graphics are amazing, complemented by a soundtrack that promotes relaxation on your journey into space.Stellaris is strongly recommended for people who love complex, long-running GRTS games.

												Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.This is the story of those 20 hours.My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took ""Spiritualist,"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.It wasn't deep enough.I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.I had to go deeperI found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions.""  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.  And we were all so, so happy.But we needed more friends.So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.And I have no regrets.Update from 5/11:I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.That's when we saved and quit until next time:In summary:I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.

												This is the story of the United Nations of Earth Star Empire and how they conquered the galaxy.My empire begun life in a small section of the galaxy named Sol.After a few years of scanning the stars and exploring neighbouring systems I meet a new friendly race. We trade minerals and energy credits and all is well.Shortly after, a fallen empire emerges and demands that we both stop expanding our territories.We form a pact against this new menace, however, even with our combined strength, their power is still 100x that of ours, a lesson we painfully learned when the fallen empire declared war on us and decimated our systems.This pattern goes on for several decades, every few years, declaring war on us, and slapping us around to make sure we knew our place.All the while, a new power, comprised of some very ugly looking aliens, is emerging on the far side of the galaxy, gaining systems, planets, and resources, and is not close enough to the Fallen Empire to be deemed a threat, which will be their undoing.Several decades go by, new races pop up and greet, or insult, us. We trade, we form pacts, we break pacts, until.... the emerging power on the far side of the galaxy is now getting close to the Fallen Empire, this causes border friction and they begin trading insults, until eventually, war breaks out between them. They trade blows off and on for several decades.This gives me and my friend time to colonise some planets and gain some power.Eventually the ugly aliens crush the Fallen Empire down to just two planets, at which point their war ends.This is where it gets interesting, for whatever reason, the Fallen Empire contats me and tells me that I'm ugly and one of the great accidents of the universe, again, he was probably still bitter about the border friction. I've deicded I've had enough, and I send my fleet into his space.I destroy what's left of his infrastructure and land a dozen armies on his planet to capture it. I win the war and effectively wipe him off the map, although, their territory was immediately taken by the ugly aliens, who now control 1/3 of the galaxy.Getting worried, I decide to keep away from them and build up my own forces, expanding away from them for a few decades.During this time, they are getting closer to my border, and they decide to intergrate my neighbour into their empire, my neighbour, is no more. I am alone.No sooner than I realise this do I get a transmission, a race not too far away from me, let's call them the Very Ugly Aliens. They contact me and accuse me of being the ugly one, despite them having more than 1 nose and sounding like a warthog.They don't like me getting close to their borders either. Every few years they randomly throw insults at me, reminding me that my race is doomed, how ugly I am, or that I should never have existed. They aren't a threat though, as their fleet power is inferior to mine, so I let him get on with it.For decades I research the best in weapons and shields technology that I can, slowly building up my forces. I have a sizable fleet when suddenly, a vast amount of large objects enter the outer rim of the galaxy. It takes a few weeks for reports to start coming in, and it appears, it's an invasion force, some to purge all life from the galaxy. They enter the space of the Very Ugly Aliens and begin their purge, being the nice neighbour that I am, I decide to help out, and my fleet gets crushed in the process.The invasion force make the mistake of scattering their fleet across several empires, this makes each force easier to deal with, and, as a galaxy, we manage to fend them off. The United Nations of Earth get the final blow, and we save the galaxy. Although this victory impresses the galaxy and carries some weight with them, it doesn't stop them insinuating that Humans wear clothes to hide their ugly bodies. The usual trade of insults continue.Two new planets emerge from the very ugly aliens and immediately ask for my protection, which I gave. I now have two small allies.Several years go by with little activity, other than me building my huge fleet. Since my fleet is getting so large, I'm running out of power, so I decide to build a Dyson Sphere around a star, this takes decades, but gives me enough power to run any sized fleet I want. I also decide to build the largest sensor array ever seen, which gives me complete coverage of the entire galaxy, I know where every fleet is at every time.At this point, the original ugly aliens now control 50% of the galaxy space, they are getting too big, and must be stopped. They used to be my friends, but have now started trading insults with me due to border friction, and have closed their borders. We declare each other as rivals.Ugly two-nosed warthog aliens are still throwing insults at me, and I decide it's time to shut them up, I declare war, although, I made the mistake of not checking who they were allied with, it was ugly alien 1 who own 50% of the galaxy, and I onwn about 20%. Their fleet power is overwhelming compared to mine, I don't stand a chance.Using my new sensor array, I could track their fleets anywhere they went. A direction confrontation would be fatal to me, so I fall back on good tactics. I play the cat and mouse game. Hitting their space ports, destroying their mining stations, then moving onto the next sector. They decide, instead of chasing me, to bomb Earth back to the stone age. They take control of Earth and Alpha Centuri and move on. As they move off, I swoop back in and regain control of them. I hit their landing parties and small fleets while their larger fleets are attacking other targets.I bomb several of his planets and land my armies on there. I now controll several of his planets, and my fleets hide in wait.He comes back to try and regain control of his planet again. By this point, his fleets are scattered between attacking my sectors, and reclaiming his own. My fleet jumps back into his sector and picks off his smaller fleet, then jumps back out.During this time, all my shipyards and churning out destroyers which immediately come to join my travelling fleet, which just keeps getting bigger and bigger.After several years of hit and run attacks, his fleets and dwindling, and I receive a transmission....""Come now Human, let us end this war before it gets out of control"" Hmmm, nope, I don't think so, he didnt even offer a consession, screen off.I continue my assault for a few more years, he keeps begging for mercy and offering me planets in the hope I'll stop, but I refuse. Eventually he surrenders and gives me several planets that I originally wanted.His fleet is now mostly destroy, warthog aliens are mostly destroyed, and I have taken control of at least 10% of their territory.They have no way to come back from this, and no one else is strong enough to take on my empire. it is only a matter of time before the whole galaxy is mine...

												This is how my multiplayer went with some friendsI started as a Militarist/Materialist/Collectivist Squid people of the Valroran Science Directorate.My two allies were the UN (Filthy humans) and the Akkadian people (Some Fungaloids).We started at the top left corner of the galaxy, we're an organized group so this was going to be a federation victory anyway. To our immediate south was a fallen empire, Fanatic Xenophobes... great. Between our 3 allied factions were a faction of horrible Insectoid people called the Vir, they were an upstart empire that had huge chunks of territory, they were an IMMEDIATE THREAT, they were Fanatic Xenophobes, Militarist, and on top of all that, they were also strong and rapid breeders. The Humans started off as the weakest of the 3 allied empires, with the Valrorans and Akkadians as the two dominant powers.Our first task was to cause chaos to our neighboring empires, invade them and liberate the new worlds under our names so they adopt our ethos and love us, it was a huge success thanks to the Akkadian Empire's massive ground armies. The entire top left of the galaxy was soon a cookie crumb of small civilizations that hated each other except for their saviors. Our next task was to destabilize the Vir roaches. It was a lengthy campaign which costed tens of thousands of lives, it took almost 60 years to break up the Vir roach empire into little vassals, even after their downfall the Vir roaches were almost impossible to deal with, being fanatic xenophobes the Vir people were almost impossible to intergrate properly into the Valroran empire without rebellious factions popping up.My empire had conquered and enslaved several primitive planets at first (Middle ages, space age civs) and adding stellar empire races into my list of slaves was starting to feel like a burden, so I immediately opted to first regulate slavery for better working conditions, then ban slavery all together. BAD IDEA. Not only were these ungrateful lesser races not happy with being emancipated, they also started forming more rebel factions faster than ever. After 10 years since I passed the law to ban slavery, I immediately reinstated it (Xenos only of course). The next 20-30 years my allies were helping me fight off rebel wars happening in my territory.Suddenly, the fallen empire to our south awakens, we almost break our economies just to field a fleet large enough to fight the greatest threat in the galaxy so far. The Valroran fleet warps in first taking the brunt of the hit, then the Akkadians and finally the Human fleet. The battle was tense, the Valroran fleet was wiped out in the first battle against the 50k fleet power Fallen Empire. We thought we had won, we suffered extremely heavy casualties, suddenly the Fallen Empire's second fleet warps in, 60k fleet power. During the battle, the Akkadian fleet suffered extremely heavy losses, losing the entire fleet in the process, but somehow the Human fleet pulled off the impossible and destroyed the remaining Fallen empire fleet with less than half its fleet power. Now the Human Empire became the strongest force in the galaxy, with the strongest lead in technology and economy, as well as fielding the most powerful ships. The Valroran owned the most planets, the Humans had the strongest tech and economy, the Akkadians had the largest and most professional ground army in the galaxy.Skipping ahead, the Fallen empire to the south was completely eradicated with technology we stole from them and a much larger overall fleet size. Not even the scourge threat were a match for our combined fleets.During peacetime, my Human ally asks me if I could purge a planet for them from the annexed fallen empire systems. (The Human empire had a strict no slavery no purging policy). They send me control over the planet temporarily, I start purging the inhabitants of the planet and pass control back to the Humans. The Valroran Empire now deals in slavery and purging services for a nominal fee, the biggest customer is the Human Democratic Utopia.Our game isn't done yet, but TL;DR: My empire has now devolved into an empire that deals in black market services such as installing slave processing plants, purging races and exporting slaves.

												I must say that I adore Stellaris overall, but in this case I think it's only fair that I review the base game. Is the base game a full experience at this point (2.1)? Sort of. In my opinion, Stellaris plus Utopia is the full game for single player purposes. All other DLCs add some neat stuff, but Utopia is pretty fundamental. I've seen other people say Utopia and all other DLCs are optional, but in my opinion you probably wouldn't want to play much more than 50-100 hours of Stellaris before buying Utopia. The other DLCs can be bought a la carte and in whatever order you like, and you can play for hundreds of hours without them.Even though I think Utopia is that important, there are several advantages of selling base Stellaris and Utopia separately:MultiplayerBecause everyone in the lobby benefits from whatever DLC the host owns, you can play the fully loaded game in multiplayer/co-op for only ~$15 on sale for the base game. This also makes it really easy to get friends to join your multiplayer Stellaris group, as you can gift someone a Stellaris key and they are completely good to go. Stellaris is a really great option for game groups, as it's relatively easy to learn (for its genre), supports dozens of players, scales well to larger groups (as it is real time rather than turn based), and AI can continue to play on someone's behalf if they stop participating in the group or can't participate in a given game night. The low cost of buy in for the base game makes this all the more appealing.Trying out the game before investing a lot of moneyWhile Utopia is needed for Ascension Paths, special civics (Synthetic Dawn is at least equally good in this regard to be fair, I'm just saying the base game lacks special civics), and any tall play styles (which really need megastructures), the base game allows all the basic empire types to be created and played with a typical wide play style.You can get a decent number of campaigns out of the base game and learn how the early and mid game work (mid-late and late game can be substantially altered by DLC) before committing to any DLC. With a game like Stellaris, it really isn't possible to try it out in the 2 hour Steam refund window.However, Steam family sharing is a better way to try it out if possible, especially if you share libraries with someone who has the DLC as you can decide for yourself what DLC is important and what you can do without.The base game serves its purpose, but you'll need Utopia for the full single player experience.

												One of the best games I have ever played. I bought it on a whim, years ago, so I could try my hand at building things. That purchase is the best I have made. After 2.5k hours, I can say you will not get bored of this game. Not only do you have the base gamemode of sandbox, allowing you to spawn NPCS, build, and do pretty much anything you want, you also have tons of multiplayer servers and workshop addons to choose from.Feel like playing a World War 2 Role Playing game? Gmod has a server running it.Want to be a clone trooper in the Star Wars universe, and earn ranks and combat ability? Gmod has a server running it.Perhaps you want to play a RTS? Maybe a murder mystery game? Hide and seek? Racing? Yup, Gmod has it all.Gmod is thousands of games for the price of one, and it is worth it 100%Trust me, you will NOT get bored of this game.

												The sky is the limit, quite literally.There are so many things you can do in this game, it makes some AAA games look small. When you buy Garry's Mod, you are really paying $10 for a blank canvas. It's up to you to find out what you want to do with it. You can mess around in the sandbox, making cities, waging wars, doing heists with friends, really there is no limit. If you don't like to use the sandbox mode, no worries. This canvas you bought can do so many other things. How about you play a game where you and many others work together to try to kill a small group of Traitors who are also trying to kill you? How about a game where you disguise as props and play a big game of hide and seek? Theres way more than just that, but I hope you get my point. Valve has given us this canvas where you can do whatever you want. The Steam workshop is your portal to all of the things you can get to shape your canvas and make your game how you want it to be. There really isn't much describing you can do with this game, because you, the player, make it what it is.

												This has to be the most polished release of Football Manager that I can remember in a long time. It feels stable, it runs smoothly, the new features seem to work (and as intended). Most importantly the Match Engine feels like it has had attention put into the right places. At first glance it might not look like too much has changed if you've been playing Football Manager for as long as I have you'll appreciate the changes to the training module and match engine. Training has made a move to units and modules, attempting to replicate what happens in professional football more accurately. Players will train in defensive and attacking units, working on phases and patterns of play linked heavily to the way you want your team to play. Where previously you'd say 'Defending' now you can say what KIND of defending - high engaging press? A low block dealing with crosses? It may seem like a small change, but for me this is what I've been after for nearly 4 years. A way to link all the different aspects of management and coaching together. The match engine has had attention placed on helping us as gamers understand what the different match engine options, sliders, and instructions do and mean. You're even provided with tactical templates to build so you can see how the instructions all link together. Want to play tiki-taka? There's a template for that that will set the team up to play that style. This is where FM19 excels for me this year, its teaching us how the game works, its helping us better understand the thought process and dedication PaulC and team have put into the match engine. There are even new user inductions for the new features too - nothing has been left to chance. Perhaps its because of this that the game has felt slightly 'easier' this year, I don't seem to be battling against how I feel an idea should work and how the match engine design makes it work. I can see changes I make within the ME taking effect. It has made it easier to exploit the weaknessess of the opposition, which now begs the question -- when will the opposition manager AI do the same thing. Hopefully FM20 can continue the progress started in FM19.More reviews on my curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/27022862-LuchaLabs/

												I very rarely leave reviews. That is because I don't regard myself competent in most of the video game genres. But it is different for football manament games. I have been playing in this genre since 1997. My addiction and love started with Premier Manager 97. Then follows the CM98/99, CM99/00. FM 2005 is still fresh in my memories. Hours of gameplay... Lots of soul breaking matches played...And now it is FM 19. I pre-ordered it. Big expectations. Bang. Incorrect squad registration roles for Turkish League. Totally unplayable in Turkey. I said ok. Football is universal. Go play somewhere else until they fix it. Took my favourite team in BPL which is Liverpool. Bang! Salah is injured for 11 months during a pre-season match. Re-started the game. Bang! Mane is gone for 9 months. Re-started the game. Bang! Salah is gone 7 months. I said ok, I will keep playing this time. 27 players in the squad. Total injuries were 145 throughout the season. Salah couldn't play a single match. Sturridge played 25 matches and scored 4 goals. The most shocking thing was I became the champion with 11 matches lost and 7 draws. I said ok. This is a pre-release game. They will fix it. They always did.But no. Not this time they did. Last time I checked I am in 90 hours in this game. The further I came with a team without deleting the save is fifth match in the second season. Here is why;1. Poor match engine optimisation- Your striker is very unlikely to score in one on one situations. And by unlikely I mean %5-10. - Your probabilty to score goals from rigth wing/left wing crosses are much higher than to score a goal from the penalty kick.- During a highlight you are very likely to see that one of your players is running completely opposite way from where everything is happening. Sometimes it is same for the other team's players.- You can easily bet your home on that if your defenders started to pass the ball back and forth, you will concede a goal.2. Poor VAR optimisation- Around %90 of the key moments in a match contains a VAR situation- The refs very unlikely to give a penalty decision without consulting the VAR.3. Player's penaltyI call this ""player's penaly"". Let me explaing what I mean. You take Chelsea. Trying to land a big name. You offer a big sum of cash. Rejected. The same transfer season your rival lands the same player for less. In another save you are Man City. You are after the same player. Offered a big sum. Gets rejected. Chelsea signs that player for less. Same scenario is also valid while negotaiting with a player. You offer 4m euro per year to a player. Gets rejected. Same player signs a contract with an AI managed club for 2m euros.One question here is very necessary. WTF?4. Translations (You don't have to read this part if your mother tongue is not Turkish)- Since the first Turkish translation is introduced, I have been forcing myself to play it in Turkish. But after a few continues, I go back to English. The very first time it was introduced, the translation was disgustingly bad. I don't remember the year, I think it was 2014. Clearly a google translation. In comparison, now it is a lot better this year. But still there is a major problem with the translation that must be addressed. And that is; I don't feel myself that I am reading the news from a Turkish newspaper or conducting a interview with the Turkish media or listening the commentary from a Turkish commentator.It feels like a word to word translation of an English sportsman commentating or asking questions. What I mean by that is there is no translation of the jargon. It is like you read a translation of your new rented property's contract. Just word by word. Even the English idioms or figurative phrases are translated to Turkish word by word which doesn't make any sense when you read them in Turkish. ""They leave with a win in their bags"" What bags? They brought their own bags before the game? Interesting huh?I mean no offense to English culture and literature here. But this doesn't give me the same vibe when I play in Turkish.5. Unjustified buzz before the release- On youtube I watched so many videos about the new purple background and a new picture in the introduction page and also a new layout in the menu.The purple background; it is just a skinThe new picture(s) in the intro; just a pictureThe new layout; took me 3 seconds to adjustI am a veteran FM player and don't give a fuchsia about any of these.With all being said, I will probably keep playing the game as it is the only AAA game in this genre. But I can't recommend this game anymore. I don't even recognize it as a game. It became a database for real proffesional football clubs with some 3d match engine in it.

												Uninstalled until they can fix the damn match engine. Just lost a cup game 6-1. Almost 30 shots. Almost 70% possesion. Had them pinned in their own 18 almost all game. But none of it matters because the only way to score is far post corners/free kicks or hoofing it upfield over defenders. 6 of 7 goals in that game were far post corners, the other was a far post wide free kick. Have played multiple teams with multiple tactics (including some default ones), only thing that ever works is kicking it over their heads or kicking it far post. Half the instructions don't even work. Hit early crosses? Nah, lets run it to the byline, then stand there while opposition closes down and wins the tackle.

												After over 300 hours in each football manager spanning back to 2012, I offically give up. The match engine is absolutely useless and dispite having a much stronger team in general I still lose because of ""morale"". The game has progressively gotten worse over the last 4 years. Probably last one ill purchase for a while. Thanks.

												I think I've now officially given up on the series. Bought football manager every year since 2006. There are normally things I don't like with the new games, normally changes in layout of gameplay that I have to adjust to and then all's fine...too much is wrong with this game I'm afraid. Gone for a refund.First thing that slaps you in the face is the privacy policy. In general I don't like the idea of them cramming adverts into the game, you don't buy a dvd and expect ad breaks, why so different for games? Insisting I accept the privacy policy however...not fun.Then there's the layout. Who ever thought purple and red is a good colour scheme? It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. Immediately changed skin to one of the other two less ugly but also less practical options. On dark skin, for example, it's pretty difficult to read some of the alternative coloured text, like the green ""play much wider"" tactical instructions. Size of everything is also weird. On 100% standard size, a lot of the text feels a bit too small, some of it comes up tiny, to the point I can't understand who they think enjoys squinting at a computer screen for hours on end. The game is a database game, reading lots of text is essential...why make it difficult? There's also lots of unused space on some of the menus which is weird, why not fill it with bigger text? You can change it to 125% size but that's then too big, you can't fit everything you need on screen at once without endless scrolling. I could say a lot more about the interface alone than this. There's the fact that you can't see what position the players that come up on scout reports are until you click on ""position and roles"" first...which is an unncessary tab to have to click on. There's how many different links you have to click on the board confidence until you can see what the actual expectations are. There's the fact the formations on the tactic screen is now placed on the left side rather than the right and you can't change it. Lots more, all minor inconveniences that make the game less practical and increasingly annoying as you try to do things more efficiently.Oh also there's how long it takes for the menu to actually appear...they've puts lots of animations on it too in an attempt to be slick (no one ever asked for this). Another small inconvenience but if your graphics card ain't great, the lag on it will irritate you.Gameplay then ofcourse...tactical changes looked really cool at first till I discovered how much the game tells you. ""Here, pick geggenpressing, here's the best formation for it with all the correct roles and team instructions sorted out for you."" And it looks really cool how you can select lots of different styles of play for a tactic, like geggenpressing, tiki taka etc but there's actually less freedom in what you can then do with them compared to previous years. It feels to easy for one, less creative for another and just...boring.Essentially I realised I was paying 37ish quid for a game I already have in football manager 2018 except it now very ugly, less practical, too easy, forces you to accept a privacy policy, and...what...has updated the player stats? Is that really worth all that money? Isn't it about time we take some responsibility and refuse to let companies squeeze money out of us when they don't deserve it? Because they don't deserve. Sports Interactive's approach to changes this game was not so much ""keep what was good about last year, change what didn't work, add innovation."" Their approach was ""what sounds really good on an advert and will pull punters in? Well, we could get more official liscences for leagues, we could claim to have made an all-new-and-improved layout, and we'll make the tactic appear for advanced."" Sports interactive know there's no other game out there to compete with them in this market and they've become lazy as a result. Don't buy it.

												as others have pointed out, the match engine is a broken mess. you can have fun with the game, just do not watch your team on the pitch. because the actual football is just horrible atm. watching your strikers actually man-marking their defenders or your defenders running around like headless chicken might seriously endanger your mental health...until it is patched do avoid this game.

												This BETA makes FM18 look like a BTEC pre-alpha version. Beautiful 3D match engine improvements w/ added goalkeeper animations and also the new skin is nice, PRESET tactics are sooooooo useful, press conferences don't feel AS repetitive (they're long as tho), training can be left to backroom staff, updated squads, GERMAN LEAGUE kits look beautiful in 3D, start uo screen and regen faces look beautiful... playing through there were so many nice things I picked up on but I forgot the rest aha. Still a couple of bugs here and there but it's a beta so it's expected in a way. This could be the first game I clock 99k+ hours on, would recomend

												I have insane amount of hours on the last few Football Managers and I can truly say that this is probably one of the best releases in the last 5 years. Man managing has been improved and worked on since last years introduction which makes it a lot more enjoyable for those who enjoy squad building. As a keen tactician I absolutely love the new additions to tactics which makes it a lot easier to play to a defined style or play which alongside fixes to the match engine has allowed tactical styles to feel different to one another instead of all counter attacking, possession, longball tactics feeling the same. Training changes are awesome too giving the game a lot more depth in player development, but the biggest change from this is that I feel like you have to rotate your squad and adjust training accordingly instead of sticking to same old routine all year. Very stable and hasnt crashed on me yet which is great for an early release game. 10/10 would go undefeated in Ligue 1 only to be denied Champions League bc of FFP again.

												Feels better than the bare minimum data update rubbish of recent years.  It feels much better and the response to the things you do seems to make more sense and feel less like a robotic time wasting exercise in doing stuff just because you know it's better if you do despite the mind numbing tedium. In summary, bearing in mind the crap we've been putting up with this last decade or so with this lot, this is definitely a step in the right direction. I think they knew the writing was on the wall and have tried to improve things and listen to their customers rather then take them for granted, so applause for that, but there's still work to be done.Remember every bug in the game play? Crosses, One v ones always missing, needing to create 30 chances to score 2 goals while the cpu beats you 3-2 with two shots total? - Yeah well all of that nonsense is still there as it always has been. The engine still needs a tear down and rebuild, but they clearly don't have the balls or the will to do so. Niftier graphical representations of action are not going to solve this. It's time to evolve lads and consign this engine to history imo. You've polished this turd to a shiny gleam, it will not polish much further methinks.Apparentlhy the injuries were sorted for release. I'm a (game time) month in and i've had ten, TEN! 2.5 a week! We haven't played a competitive game yet, my training intensity is low, and i've been giving the players 45-60 minute run outs. It's bloody bonkers! If this is the injury issue fixed, then you need to look again. All in all, at first glance it feels like we're getting there, but i feel like it's just better stuff bolted onto the same old problems tbh, and when i've had a decent amount of time to assess what's what, i'll probably end up hating myself for being such an idiot again and giving my cash to people who probably don't deserve it all things considered. Right now though, i like most of what i see.What these lot need is some decent competition to give them a proper kick up the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i don't see that happening any time soon tbh. If like me you've been bitterly dissapointed with pretty much every release in the last decade or so, then probably you'll see past the gloss, however, that said, this feels like a much better effort and whilst it won't make up for feeling fleeced by these people over the last decade or more, it's certainly now approaching the game it needs to be. They need to be braver and tackle the match engine though, they really do.			"

												Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!

												Disclaimer: I survivor main. I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!

												Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares, I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build-up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside, I enjoy a good chase, or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right, and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky, and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however, getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole, because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them, each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game, and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook, which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing, and so I will recommend.

												 ENGLISH After playing for more than two years, I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible, so if you do not want to see the full review, I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub-sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part, the killers must pursue, hang, sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks, objects, accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as:PalletsWindows360'sMoonwalksHideDifferent powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game.

Where killing requires significantly more concentration, survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player, but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear, but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles, and the killers have completely different ""powers"" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something, then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time-waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame, but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game  factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.

												Sigh... this is the hardest review I've had to write.This game is interesting, compelling, and original. The game mechanic is great. The CORE game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way I've never experienced, even in metal gear games. Its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer.Unfortunately, the game is riddled with bugs. This current update (2/13/2017) made the game unplayable. And that's not me ♥♥♥♥♥ing about minor changes in game play mechanics... its literally broken and won't launch. I've held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down. Welp the cows have come to pasture and I feel that after playing 120 hours of the game, posting on steam forums about bugs, participating in test servers, and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think I've earned the right to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it. Hell, I'm a paying consumer so why not?Yesterday I played this game almost all day and night long. In that day, after hearing about the new patch I logged every game I was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors. My logs for yesterday are as Follows:68 attempted games played51 games that did not load, crashed, errored out etc.17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were playedThat means the application worked correctly only 25% of the time. All I can say is to stay away from this game. Its not working anymore... and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times.If you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as I did (when it decides to work), put pressure on those devs. Thier game, as fun as it may be, is a defective product.  IT needs to be fixed or WE need to be reimbursed. You pay thier salary... not Behavior, not StarBreeze... YOU!PS, Devs... I will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should. It is not my intention to keep people from buying YOUR games... it is only to keep people from buying BROKEN games.PPS, Devs... after fixing this game, how likely would it be to see another crossover monster/survivor combo?  I really wanna see a Ripley / Xenomorph or James Sunderland / Pyrimid Head update (just play Konami for the license you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its dirt cheap right now)

												Dead by Daylight is an amazing assymetrical survival horror game. I will provide a pro/con list, and then rebuttle the most common negative claims against the game.  Pros * Developers are active within the community* Lots of progression and levelling to give you a reason to keep coming back* Survivor perks from DLC are accessible to those without DLC, only requiring extra effort.* Game is, despite what some players may say, balanced.* Allows teamplay with minimal communication* Lots of tension, and some required decision making* Long lifetime, game produced 1 year ago, and still supports an average of 8,000-10,000 players per day Cons * Decent amount of the community is toxic, but welcome to the internet* Peer to Peer connection (If the killer's internet is bad, your ping/connection will be bad)* There are a fair amount of bugs/glitches in the game, but none are entirely game breaking.  Rebuttles One popular claim is that the game is horrible due to it's toxic community. My main contention here is that the game does not permit voice chat, and instead provides you with two emote options. One to point, and one to wave. Some survivors will tbag on the other side of objects just to aggravate/annoy the killer, but that isn't really a viable issue to hate the game for. Overall the coommunity is no reason to hate the game, and it isn't even that severe. A second, extremely popular complaint, is that camping a surviver that is on the hook as the killer is overpowered and should be removed somehow (which would be incredibly complicated to do from a development standpoint). The issue with this complaint is that the only time when camping is affective is when all of the survivors commit their time playing to attempting to save the survivor on the hook. If instead, the survivors chose to work on generators, statistically they could each get over 1 generator done before the player on the hook died. This would allow the players to complete enough generators to escape with only 1, or if unlucky 2... survivors being sacrificed. The issue is not with the game, it is yet again an issue with the failure of players to adapt.Another claim is that the new killer, The Huntress, is absolutely unbalanced. The reason for a lot of complaint is that The Huntress is the first ranged killer in the game. Is she overpowered though? Not at all. I have played against an incredibly large amount of killers choosing to play The Huntress, especially seeing as it was released just one day before I made this review, and have won the vast majority of the matches. The Huntress was placed into the game to allow for both far more variation in gameplay, and to shake up the ""meta"", forcing players to adapt. The issue with that is, however, a lot of players do not wish to spend time adapting, and instead resort to despising the developers. I appreciate their attempts to add far more variation and effort into the game. One key detail that people who complain about the new killer fail to mention very often, is that the new killer can be heard from much further away, allowing for the survivor to react quicker, and hide appropriately. Although some may say that the sound of the killer's humming is quiet, in a game such as Dead by Daylight, sound is everything. You should be prepared to commit your attention entirely to the game during a match. If you do not, then your failures are not a result of the development team.Many players also complain about the lack of voice communication, because they do not feel as if your current implemented communication methods, pointing and waving, are effective enough. However, as seen with Friday the 13th: The Game, you will absolutely ruin any hopes of immersion and tarnish the horror aesthetic when you enable voice chat, which results in players blasting loud shrek theme songs through their microphones, or yelling the entire game so that you, again, can not pay as much attention too the actual game. A reply to my claim might say that you could simply permit blocking players so that you may not hear them. However, if as you said, the community is toxic, how many players do you honestly think you will not have to block? Even if you don't have too block people in a game, the killer would suffer tremendously from that communication. It is for this reason that a majority of people playing killer in the game recognize that survive with friends (swf) is even nearing overpowered. This is because the implementation of a survivor queueing system allows for survivors to communicate more, and better counter the killer during a game. If there is a great deal of hate towards a smaller system such as swf which even slightly allows voice communication, the development team should surely know better than to implement a full voice communications system for players. And they do, so I commend them for their resilience with putting up with the community's failure to fully think out their complaints. I may update this review if I either recall more additions I wished to add, or other issues are brought to my attention. TL;DR: People who complain about this game's issues, and quit the game due to them, do not fully understand the implications of either changing the matter, or just what they are talking about. This gameis great and worth a buy, and a popular complaint about the toxic community can explain away a great deal of people's poor reviews. 			"

												Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10

												 You feel an evil presence watching you... This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.  Fortune and glory kid...

												I have played this game for 1,055 hours.This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.

												This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.ProsCustomization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.Exploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see ""The Creation of the Guide"" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising.Creativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest.Progression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.Balance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.Diversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.Automation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.Performance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory.Quality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.Continued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.ConsNew player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.Grinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue.Moddability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.

												I’d only wish I had played this game sooner!Terraria if a fascinating game, that introduces players to an open, 2D world that features adventure, building, crafting, boss battles and much more. As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant, I’ll be commenting for both game experiences.The vanilla [original] game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build, in the later game you’ll be introduced to more content, new areas, enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression, which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear, plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same, as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice; the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable, including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.Now, for the mod version, there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters, items, NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it “cheats” and whatnot. However, this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game, and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus, and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience, the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you’ve completed the original game.In general, Terraria is a must-play for anyone who hasn’t done so.

												Terraria at first glance can be called a ""2D Minecraft"" from some viewers, but it surprisingly has a lot of differences.For starters, while Terraria is indeed a 2D sandbox game, the main highlight of the game isn't just creating whatever you want, but working your way up from basic equipment up to fighting space invaders and SQUIDLORD. ..er excuse me, the ""Moon Lord"".Speaking of equipment, at no point what-so-ever do your tools or armor ever break. There's also currency in the form of bronze, silver, gold, and platinum coins which can be used to buy goods from friendly NPCs. Said friendly NPCs can appear if you fufill certain conditions and have a vacent room for them. So on and so forth there are many differences between this and Minecraft that makes the whole comparison silly to bring up.Though I won't be praising everything about the game, as it does have some flaws. For starters, while the PC version has no tutorial, every other version of the game has one. There are console and mobile exclusive events, items, and even music which was a personal pet peeve for me. Some accessories made from combining others together end up being less useful than if you were to use the two seperately or create an entirely different accessory, the fishing achievements are quite a nightmare to go after, and the beginning can be VERY tedious, especially in Expert Mode. Throwing weapons are also useless past the Wall of Flesh, with a majority of items involving throwing capabilities being thrown out of the window by the time Skeletron comes around.Do these gripes of mine hinder the experience as a whole?I don't think so, and I still think the game is worth checking out if you're into games such as this.An additional bonus, there's also a pretty awesome modding community for the game too, which adds even more things you can do with the game long after you taken care of the vanilla game's final boss. Some recommended mods to check out would be Leveled, Thorium, and Calamity.I'd highly recommend getting Terraria if you haven't yet, especially if it's on sale. Though I would also recommend playing the game with friends, as it's muuuuuuch more fun and also not as tedious. ..maybe.

												Payday 2 is a fantasticly fun game, which gets even more enjoyable with friends. The gunplay is nice, the skills give tons of different playstyles, the heists are enjoyable, and the music is amazing. I would completely recommend this game to anyone if it was made by a different developer. Sadly, it's made by Overkill.See, Overkill is known for keeping in touch with their community. And that's not a bad thing; it's great, actually. If they actually ♥♥♥♥ing listened to their community, that is, instead of just pretending to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the people that play it. Overkill loves money, never forget it. They release tons of DLC, did a whole ""completely free event"" back in the Spring where you had to buy DLC to unlock more rewards, and now did another ""completely free event"" where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts.Now, whether or not you consider this Pay 2 Win or not is your opinion, as it is a coop game. But it's still ♥♥♥♥ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event, have them work hard to get all the rewards, then day ♥♥♥♥ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts.This is a great game. It was made by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer. If you want to still spend your money on it, go ahead, but be ready to feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥when Overkill once again manages to ♥♥♥♥ over their community for that cash.

												I got 700h+ on record, bought almost all DLCs and now the developer breaks promises (no microtransactions) and adds paid stat boosting skins to weapons.Can't recommend the game as long as this feature is not changed to at least only cosmetical skins.

												MEGA EDIT a year later edition:So They set the Drills for free,now all the ""new"" safes are free to open,all the old ""one's"" still require to buy a drill to open.Today 30/05/16 Overkill pre-announced the update #100 for the game,basically they bought the game rights back from the publisher(505Games)and announced that the priced drills will be REMOVED for ALL the upcoming safes,this basically mean that the safes will keep dropping but that they will automatically be open for FREE,no more drills,you can still trade the skins but NO NEED to use drills to open the safes(all the ""old"" safes will still require a drill to be opened but they will remove the drop for them).Now this means they actually better now no more Overkill liars? kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkill Here[www.twitch.tv] they said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...Now that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)So as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.My review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.EDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that ""force"" them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or max 50% true,what is sure is that Overkill agreed with the introduction of MT's,maybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knows,people think that after several months after the Black market update aka skins and MT's introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for free,so basically there's still a lot of stuff from Overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better.[""OLD"" review will remain here as reminder of what happened]As you can see from my hours on record,i'm a PayDay 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this game/devs since the start lovelly idea's and a Developer different from the other one's,i saw a lot of things change,some were cool and fantastic,some less but Overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they don't like and as always i was there enjoying the game,a Developer that actually listen to the user request/feedback is hard to find this days,that's one of the reason why Overkill WAS my favorite game Dev,some months ago they started releasing REALLY low quality and Buggy DLC at full price every month,the last one was the worst of all time(chyvarly DLC)and now at the time of this review,they introduced micro-transaction in the game,just to let you know they always said that they will NEVER introduce Micro-transaction in the game because they said they absolutly don't like that kind of things,and today they've done the exact opposite.EDIT:21/10/2015 In the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushed/last moment card drop called the Wolf Card that give's you a drill for free,nice move Overkill nice move,but it's not what we asked,the Micro-transaction have to leave FOREVER,they never was something to add to this game as Almir said at the game launch ""We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)"" this is someting that have to be removed,you lied to us Overkill,and that's what you got Tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world.EDIT:25/10/15 Worst crimefest ever,a fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as ""rewards"".The next time try harder and remove the micro-transaction.EDIT:07/11/15 ""Player seem to be loving it"" almir listo I'm not so sure about that Almir(currently at 76% on Steam,3.3 on Metacritic)The absolute disaster of the Almir AMA on redditAlmir dodging the question LIVE on Twitch[www.twitch.tv]EDIT:13/11/15 They ♥♥♥♥ed up the game even more now glad they(not) heard our feedback,introducing even more Pay2Win microtransaction(Random crew bonus at a price of half a dlc)and the not so surprising after all this mess COP reward a 1/25 Random skin with random specs after 6+ months of waiting G♥♥♥♥ingG overkill,even the moderators here on steam and on Reddit refuses to moderate the forum's again and support this madness.

												With the addition of paid skins, the game is now an oversaturated dlc fest with microtransactions. Avoid if possible. Will adjust review accordingly if the skins system is reworked to not be a microtransaction cash grab, or is removed entirely, but as it stands right now, its shameful and disgusting.			 
				Posted: October 15, 2015
												Well, I see Overkill f*%ked everyone over, yet again.  I don't play this game anymore, I haven't for around 3-4+ months now (From when this review was made), and I don't plan on coming back to it again, especially at the rate that it's going.Can I just point out before I state the obvious that this p*ss poor compnay, has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people, are actually tired of their s*%t?They promised things like safe house customization, a new enemy, and a few other things here and there.  Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No.  Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.Not to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's ""New content"" when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII.  It's basically saying ""We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons.""Now then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.Talk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdYRBDMJpI""The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER"" Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face.  The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system.  ""Oh that's just like CSGO though!"" Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose.  Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade.  ""Oh you don't want the crate?"" CSGO would say, ""Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!"" Payday = ""Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch.""2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT.  I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.Ending = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it?  F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to.  It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.Fight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing?  Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it!  Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up.  Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gifEdit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation.  Really? That's, it? It's not even client sided it's based off of other players, there is litterally, no difference.  That's your guys' BIG ending to this? A jumping animation? That does absolutely nothing? You people are a f**king disgrace.  So, I found this http://i.imgur.com/XtYVomn.png Let that just sink in a bit to show what little tw@'s they truly are.

The response was always: ""but the models are too low res"" (Which is now invalid since it's clear they could've fixed that at any time.) or ""You can already do that in goon mod"" (But only you see it, so also invalid)The other problem is the stats tagged onto them when they just nerfed a bunch of guns. They gimped weapons and are now selling them back to us.We worked to unlock this for free with the understanding that anything we didn't unlock would be paid. If we didn't get that goal would it have been dlc? No. All the goals were guaranteed to be unlocked from the start. Just like last crimefest with wick. A guise to build hype for the playbase. (I didn't mind wick but the means by which he was given to us was crap).The game has a ton of DLC already. I've spent like 200$ on this game.Skins can be for DLC weapons that you don't own.This game isn't in the proper genre nor do it's mechanics support this system. You're not expressing your style with these skins like you do with your gun mods or mask or build. This one element contradicts the rest of the game's design fundamentals.I've bought every dlc up to this point and always looked forward to more but now I regret all of that. I don't even want to play anymore, I'm just disgusted by this whole thing.The player count was dead today. Nobody wanted to play this. They need to revert this. I don't even think it should have crates at all. I wish we could just get the gun customization we've always wanted. They just proved it's possible and now it's even more aggravating.

												The lovely story of a crew who cant buy a drill that doesnt get jammed			 
				Posted: October 15, 2015
												I used to love this game and I would play it almost every day.  However, with the recent update adding skins with stat boosts that can only be obtained through microtransactions, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  The game was already leaning towards Pay2Win with all the DLC that added weapons that were superior to the vanilla weapons, but the game was still amazing and fun without any DLC.  Sadly Overkill has given up and they aren't even trying to hide the fact that the game is Pay2Win anymore.  So it's up to you of you want to buy this game, but I would not recommend it.  What used to be fun has now become a mess of microtransactions.			 
				Posted: October 15, 2015
												Although my review shows not recommended, I do recommend this game, specially if you have friends to play with, it's way more enjoyable. I got a bit salty after some of Overkill's actions and they have redeemed themselves for the most part, they still updated the game during 2018 with free heists and returning heists from PDTH.Updated: November 23rd, 2016They introduced some changes, like two new difficulties, and other free content to the community. Looks like after the turmoil last year they are back on track trying to improve the game. The new difficulties seem rushed, there aren't a lot of viable builds. Questionable DLC business model is still up. Actually it's more challenging and fun to play with the vanilla and free community weapons. The problem with DLCs are the paid heists, you need them if you want to host those heists, but you can still join lobbies if you don't own these. The problem will be finding those lobbies.Updated: June 6th, 2016Some things have changed, and others did not. OVERKILL removed the paid safes/drills from drop rotation, although you can still open them if you buy a drill, so they kept the microtransactions. They are changing it in the near future though, so new safes will drop and users will be free to open them, or sell them on Steam Market. I have no problem with that, as long as it keeps accessible for everyone without a pay wall.They also changed/updated the game with some free content since my last review update, and few other paid DLCs.It seems they are launching less DLC but the paid DLC model has not changed though, they still keep releasing themed DLC split in two packs, like the Biker Heist and Biker Character Pack, those could easily be a single pack. At least they will keep supporting the game until 2017, which is definitely a good thing. Users decide if they want to buy DLC or not, but lets hope the quality is good. Buy it on sale, on the cheap :)Update: After Black Market Update 79 / October 15th, 2015OVERKILL introduced new microtransactions with random safe card drops and drills and weapon skins, equivalent to CS:GO weapon cases and keys and skins with steam market support, also similar to a model of free-to-play games. The difference is that PD2 is a paid game and those skins actually boost some stats.Adding microtransactions was something they said they never would do.Developer can't keep their word:...We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and... > http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521They launched a ""weapon rebalance"" patch with the excuse to increase diversity and versatily of other weapons. The thing is, with some stats being nerfed and stats boost added to skins, seems like a clear move from them to incite people buying those skins.Pistols making more damage than heavy shotguns and assault rifles. What is this nonsense? To bring some shotguns back to their level before the ""rebalance patch"" you have to use special ammo, that is a feature of Gage Shotgun Pack, a DLC that wasn't required now is.In the process of updating their game, popular mods were killed because OVERKILL made changes on how the game worked with LUA modification scripts. OVERKILL claims that breaking mods was not intentional. But how can you trust someone's word if they went back on it already? Call it conspiracy theory but maybe they just wanted to protect their new investment (microtransactions) to prevent malicious scripts from tampering with the game and finding a way to get easy safe card drops. Now it's gonna take a lot of unpaid effort from modders to get things working again, or maybe those mods will be just dead.Mods are in the process of being fixed. Several of them are working again. Unfortunately some good modders got disgusted by recent OVERKILL choices and abandoned their mods :(Old/first reviewVery good game to play Co-Op with friends. Even playing with random people can be fun. Playing solo is usually not fun (I think solo play is suitable for stealth), but it's not the idea of the game. Some heists you can go loud or stealth, which renders a unique course as the heist takes place, or you can even do some of the heist in stealth and the rest loud. Could have more missions although they have some variation from time to time, It's a good thing that the developer is always launching new patches with improvements and bug fixes.Since the Death Wish patch, despite adding a new difficulty and some particular changes to the heists some aspects of the game were changed. Some of those changes modified the way certain skills worked and how they were implemented, and the most dramatic change was to the Stealth mechanics. I think those changes balanced the game better, in some ways it made the game more challenging, The new stealth mechanics requires more situational awareness and avoiding detection, it's not ""bad"", it works well for some heists but it makes luck to play a bigger part in other heists. I enjoy both Stealth and the Full assault gameplay but I enjoyed the ""old stealth"" because it was more simple and less time consuming, waiting and luck played lesser parts.Since my initial review there was a good amount of new heists added, some in free updates, most in paid updates (DLC). Despite heist DLCs most DLC packs are for weapons, masks, materials and characters. Missing some optional content isn't game breaking, but the DLC are too many and there are small things that could certainly be already in the game like a sniper rifle, light machine gun, grenades, more good weapon mods: all this was included behind a paywall (DLC), which is not nice. Also some DLC make the game somewhat easier, which feels that it's a bit of a ""pay to make it easier"" DLC.After so many hours playing I still enjoy playing with friends, so I still enjoy the game, although it's a bit tiresome to play the same heists over and over, so I tend to play only the Death Wish difficulty which still puts some challenge. The Infamy system is useful until Level 5 because it discounts the number of points you have to spend to unlock higher skills in the skills tree, so you can make better builds spending less points. Beyond that it's just more grinding for a few masks, materials and patterns.I don't like the random card/loot system that awards you items or masks, even useless money or little EXP boosts, I think it should be reworked. The rewards should be more balanced so everyone feels rewarded playing every single heist.Pros:+ Great Co-Op fun with friends!+ There is some variety of heists, but it becomes tiresome after many hours playing over and over the same maps+ Stealth or Full assault option on most situations+ The developer is present and tries to update the game with good frequency+ The new stealth adds a new challenge and situational awareness+ Good range of skills. You can specialize or make good builds depending on your role in the heists+ Many weapons are available and can be modified, although some are DLC exclusive, but I have to say that most weapons I use are those included in the game and community updates.Cons:- ""New stealth"" is more waiting game in certain situations than really a matter of being skilled.- The Infamy system is too much grinding for little reward- The rewards (loot system) should be rebalanced and reward the player more with more rare items- DLCs are too many, some things could be already in the full game or included for everybody. At this point all the DLC together cost way more more than the original game.- Some weapon and character perk deck DLC make the game easier in certain ways, which unbalanced compared to the original free loadout of the game.

												I don't support cash-grabbing attempts and sincerely hope they remove it entirely.Apart from the cash-grab attempt that is the Creation Club:Fallout4 did not live up to the hype. While the visuals are certainly an upgrade to its predecessors, almost every other element takes more than a few steps down the ladder. The role-play element that seemed to be the primary focus of 3 and New Vegas is gone, you have almost no impact on the story or events. Multiple paths to the same goal have diminished to ""path 1 kills these guys, path 2 kills those guys. There are no more alternate paths.""Part of this degredation to the roleplay element comes in the form of the voiced protaganist; voice lines are expensive and as such you now have a choice between 4 dialog options at all times - no more and no less. Installing the mod to show you the full sentence they speak, rather than a vague descriptor (sarcastic is always an option) you see that more often than not ALL dialog options achieve the same thing. Yes, I'm not sure but I guess so, sarcastic yes, no... but I have to. Branching paths exist only in superficial forms such as which faction you choose to represent. Regardless of which faction you choose, you will be performing the same exact quest and quest goals but for different quest givers in different places. In other words, they're the same. The illusion of choice is a STRONG element in FO4, and they don't do a particularly good job of maintaining the ILLUSION part of it.Combat is lackluster. Mechanically, the guns work fairly well, but fall flat in other ways. Guns are extremely weak, legendary enemies such as the legendary raider will take dozens of shots to the head to kill. Scaling enemies work the same as they did in Skyrim. Between the levels of 1-12 the raiders are level 9. Meaning at level 12, they're easy but at 1 they're very hard. As soon as you reach level 13 they scale up for the 13-21 bracket. Now they're level 18. This means that in leveling up from 12-13 you made the same enemies signficantly harder! This is a very poor means of scaling and arguably scaling should be removed altogether. Some areas would be impossible at low levels, but you could work your way up to them or stealthily explore them. Eventually you'd be good enough to take on the challenge. But instead, with scaled enemies like this, you can just go anywhere at any time as long as you're at the right point of the bracket.The gun selection is deceptively small, almost everything is a variation of the pipegun. Other guns do exist such as the revolver. but they're extremely rare and odds are you'll be using 3 variations of the pipegun for short, medium and long range. All of which are ugly, boring, and nowhere near realistic for their caliber. Not to mention, gun damage should only increase or decrease with a change of caliber; NOT with a change of items like the stock, which should only increase accuracy and recoil.Quests are almost entirely fetch, 'explore' and 'liberate'. Explore quests are glorified fetch quests that essentially complete themselves once you pass a trigger at the end of a 'dungeon'. Only now, you're not bringing anything back. The quest could have said to kill all enemies in the 'dungeon' but as long as you pass this trigger, the quest is complete. Dead enemies or not. Liberate quests on the other hand do require you to kill all of the enemies, but these are almost exclusively for gaining new settlements.Settlements are boring, the selection of items is small, creativity can be achieved but the building system is so clunky and ugly you won't be finding amazing creations from anyone who hasn't modded the game. TL;DRThe illusion of choice is so strong you effectively have no choice at all. The story is lackluster and filled with concerns, settlements are ugly and clunky, combat level brackets ruin difficulty, legendary enemies can be impossible and far beyond realistic and weapon selection is deceptively small where almost every gun you see is just a variation of the pipe gun.

												Fallout 4.Heartaches by the number.Fallout 4 is a title that, in relation to the previous games, took one great step forward technically and mechanically - but twenty enormous leaps backwards in terms of roleplaying, writing, dialogue, and quests. Fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originals, New Vegas, and even Bethesda's own Fallout 3; trading that out for an experience more akin to Borderlands than any other mainline Fallout release. I'm not outright saying that Fallout 4 is a terrible game, it's far from it, but it's simply not the game Fallout and RPG fans rightly expected.Fallout 4 starts with an excellently produced opening cinematic explaining the state of the world in the year 2077, and then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in Boston, Massachusetts. From here you choose either the husband or the wife to play as, and then customize the look of your character to your liking. After a bit more exposition, you find yourself running with your spouse (your infant in their arms), to a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come. Due to events unspoiled in this review, you emerge 210 years later - the sole survivor of Vault 111 - on a mission to reconnect with your missing child, who is no longer in the vault when you emerge.As exciting as that opening-plot summary may have sounded, any veteran of the Fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it. Fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated world, with seemingly innumerable options. None of that is true in Fallout 4 however, because the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypse, have had a spouse at some point, have a child, be either a military vet (the husband) or a lawyer (the wife), and will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their child, which should make all other content meaningless until you have. This kills one of the most iconic aspects of the Fallout series; player narrative freedom. It's the basis for why I've not recommended this game, as it's the first domino to fall that proves Fo4 is not a Fallout RPG, which will be explained further.Switching to something more positive; I think Fallout 4 looks superb. The textures and faces are just passable, but the lighting(+godrays), modeling, animation, and artistic design of the Boston ruins are all visually stunning. The game even performs markedly well for a Bethesda title, apart from some FPS drops in the downtown areas. There were several bugs on release, but most of those issues are fixed now. For once, I have no major complaints about the performance of a Fallout game.Another favorable aspect of Fo4, would be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series. The shooting is now both precise and reactive, and the AI is clever enough to have some self-preservation instincts. Most fights are undertaken while exploring, and as for the exploration, I'd say it's just as good as you'd expect from any Bethesda game. The world is full of interesting places, and most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration. However, there is one caveat to these mechanics.The issue I have with the combat/exploration duo; is the horseshoe design of most of Fallout 4's dungeons. This is to say, the type of design Skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level. This is an okay design choice within itself, but considering this is Fallout, where the places you explore are meant to be realistic settings, the horseshoe level structure gets repetitive, and by consequence, immersion breaking - early on in the game. Otherwise, the broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors though.The last encouraging thing I have to say about Fo4, is that the power armor, crafting, and settlement systems are all awesome. Power armor is finally given the depiction it deserves, as it's now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives. The crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the game, allowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armor, and to build settlements. The new settlement system is basic, but thematically makes sense in the world of Fallout, as it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own well-being. While I don't agree that gameplay gimmicks are where Fallout should target its energy, these systems are well constructed and engrossing, nonetheless.Refocusing on Fallout's main tenants of design, I'll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious. The leveling system in Fo4 removed skills from its makeup, and now relies solely on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and perks. This is a problem, because the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 70 perks (many of which are boring stat-multipliers), where as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 1-100, which made for incredible variation in player type, as well as more worthwhile perks. To compound this issue, Fo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas based on the character you've built; making progression pointless in roleplaying terms.Speaking of things in Fallout 4 that are pointless, the choices are too. Well, that isn’t entirely true, some quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situation, but in essence you can't choose to be anything but a constant quest-sponge. This is partially due to the aforementioned, restrictive progression system, but the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversation, that you can't kill people you don't like because half of all named characters are essential, and you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue. Player ""choice"" at its finest. Oh, and as for the damned dialogue...Yet another dumbed-down aspect of Fo4 that was once essential to the series, is the dialogue. The crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response options, even when more or less may be fitting. This makes conversations feel inhuman, in an uncanny-valley way, which bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests. Characters (other than SOME companions) are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrow, and quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairs, because the dialogue is not built for intense, thoughtful debates. Every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointment, and I’ll expose why.Take a moment to consider this fact: there is not a single writer credited for the creation of Fallout 4. The lead designer, Emil Pagliarulo, is the only person whose job description even partially included writing. This illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplaying, dialogue, choices, and quests; as they require a consistent team of professional writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony. That's what's at the heart of Fo4's troubles in my eyes; a complete disrespect towards writing in any form, which is what made Fallout what it is today.When it comes down to it, Fallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that; a game. What it is decidedly not however, is a Fallout RPG, because to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous Fallout's so great. Those who have not played a Fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy Fo4, but as a long standing fan of the franchise, and as someone whose favorite game series was Fallout, all Fo4 gives me; is heartaches by the number.Personal Rating: 6/10 - Entirely Mediocre(Posted On: 8/13/17)

												I'm so sick of corporate greed.And it didn't take long until it would consume one of my favorite developers back in the day. It saddens me to think about what the gaming industry is turning into, and seems it will only get worse. Maybe I'm just too old and too reluctant to change and adapt, maybe I can't see the greater good that might come out of the Creation Club.And I can't with clear mind, support this decision. Decision which wasn't driven by the love towards the product, or respect towards the players, but a decision that was driven purely by greed.It worries me that this is the beginning of something much worse.Paid mods. Premium content. Mini DLCs. It doesn't matter which words are used to describe Creation Club, when intention behind it is clear. Modding has been around for a very long time, it's a whole sub-culture. And regardless of the game, there was always one thing in common - modding has always been about passion. And that's why we keep getting amazing, mindblowing mods to this day.There are some unwritten rules in this whole story, but respect and passion are the key words. Not money. And I'm worried that if Creation Club keeps this momentum, it will take away more than it will give. So far it's contained within Bethesda's ecosystem, soon to corrupt Skyrim and surely their future releases. But what if all developers and publishers continue the same practice in the future? What if it becomes a standard?We vote with our wallets.I'm not glad of the backlash, I'm not glad that I have to give negative review based on the business decision, and not the game itself. This shouldn't have happened in the first place. But gamers understand when they're being played. And we have to show that we're not mindless sheep consuming everything that's thrown at us, without a second of a doubt.Why interfere with system that worked well before? Modders have been keeping Bethesda's games alive for over a decade, and now they've come up with the idea of premium mods, that are supposed to be higher quality than those on Nexus. And no modders are credited. There is no transparency. Creation Club is a collection of dead cells that will grow into a unstoppable cancer if we don't treat it early.

												Creation Club, aka: Selling mods.You know what's smart? Selling mods. That totally worked out fine on the Xbox and Playstation. It also worked out extremely well on PC when they shoved it in for Skyrim. You know what else went well? How well recieved it was for modders who cashed in. The modders got so much respect and had no problems what so ever.You know what especially didn't happen when paid mods were introduced to Skyrim? The ""mod store"" sure as hell didn't get spammed with duplicate mods and random people trying to cash in on other people's work, work that was free prior to paid mods(And which was taken down and transfered as paid mods as soon as paid mods became a thing). You know what else didn't happen? The ""mod store"" also wasn't infested with a bunch of useless waste of time, cash grab, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""mods"" that some♥♥♥♥♥♥threw together in five minutes. /sarcasmSeriously, I'm so fed up of the games industry right now. We've got season passes, ""remasters"" of games that are only a year or two old, a bunch of microtransactions not included in season passes(While being sold and released during the season pass' life), we're also seeing the advent of multiple season passes, not just a single season pass per game but upward of three or more season passes for a single game being refreshed every six ♥♥♥♥ing months. On top of this? We've got lootboxes. Lootboxes upon lootboxes in literally every single game being released these days which ranges from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics which used to be free and unlockable to full on items to make your weapons better(Like the old days of P2W in F2P MMO's). You know how far they've gone now? Lootboxes, paid boosts and ""legendary"" units/items only obtainable through lootboxes, in single player games. Yes. Single player games now have RNG(Basically gambling) lootbox ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in them that give progression boosts. ♥♥♥♥. This.♥♥♥♥♥♥Now, the absolute worst of it is the fact that what was once free is now paid(Which seems to be a very common trend these days in the €60 ""Triple Ayy"" games industry). This is content that makes Bethesda's games what they should have been on release and adds a bunch of QoL improvements that should have been in the game on release and haven't actually been developed by Bethesda. Bethesda make the worst inventory systems and have done for years now. It's always been up to the community to fix it and make sense of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ organisation in inventory across all Bethesda games. Now, with paid mods, you'll be expected to pay €2-€5 for a simple inventory QoL fix. Like, wtf?! You can't justify this crap. Let's also not forget the fact that there's no gaurentees that these mods will be supported in the future. So, say you buy a mod. Your game gets updated. Your mod breaks and the modder who created it doesn't update the mod. Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ You're SOL and just wasted your money and, possibly, your hundreds of hours game save that relied on a mod to work. Congrats, you've just paid some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Bethesda to ♥♥♥♥ you in the♥♥♥♥♥and take away hundreds of hours of gameplay away from you.And then you have the whole shitbrigade defending this crap and saying ""Oh, but these things won't be paid mods!"" but they will. They absolutely will. Give all this♥♥♥♥♥♥time and before you know it your favourite inventory mod or travel mod or whatever the hell you like will shift from free to unsupported unless you pay. Then we've got the precedence of what it sets for future titles where this♥♥♥♥♥♥is baked into the game and there will be no way to support mods outside of it, as in Bethesda and other companies will lock down these games so they can not be modded without using their service. I don't need to explain just how much of an impact that will have on PC gaming. Just remember the amount of freedom as PC gamers we will lose when files and sections of games are locked behind some Single Player DRM which only purpose is to stop people from installing mods outside of the built in ""service.""Just remember that everything that was said five-ten years ago about microtransactions came true. Every. Single. Thing. Now every game has microtranscations. Now every MP game has ♥♥♥♥ing in-game shops to buy skins, weapons, boosts and whatever the hell else. Now every game has a ♥♥♥♥ing season pass. Now most -- at least -- have locked DLC or ""microtransactions"" gated on release unless you ""pre-order"" or pay extra for this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just as it was with microtransactions and the warnings we had about that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ten years ago it's going to be the exact same with paid mods. If this♥♥♥♥♥♥sails, in two to three years time we're going to see DRM for mods(Which is already a thing from the Skyrim paid mods fiasco btw) in every single mod, the mod scene move from being as open and dynamic to allow people to create what they want and enjoy to a more business orientated system which caters to those who make, basically, FotM content. What will happen then? No more breakouts like Battlegrounds, survival genres, nothing because every single modder and their mother will be trying to cash in on flavour of the month ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t content with not a single bit of original thought between them.This is not good for gaming. This kind of content should never have paywalls blocking entry other than the initial purchase of the base game. If a mod really goes beyond and sets a game aside then it should be up to the developers/publishers of said game to reward the modder, not have others pay for it.This is not good.

												A teenage developer who manages to realease great updates every week, new, detailed maps several times a year and no pay to win; this is my type of game.  500 hours and still enjoying myself, the Gold Upgrade lets you change the colour of your skin (Possible to abuse as camoflague, however, but no other advantages of any kind. It is more a donation than a DLC. That's why I bought it, this guy deserves it.EDIT: This review is recieving a lot of critique, to clear up: Most free to play games rely on overpowered bonuses to get people to buy in game products. This game lets you camoflague better and have more storage space. As a comparison, for a free to play game, this really isn't bad.EDIT 2: It's free to play, it seems you are all expecting free to play games to be pitch perfect AAA games developed by a team of 100 experienced developers. This is a one man operation. For the price you are paying and what you are getting, this is a good game.

								Easily one of the best free to play games on Steam. This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do. You only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time!The beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is. I still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to ""donate"" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no ""BUY HP FOR 5$"", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to ""Premium"" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it.There's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :)There are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness  percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it.Do you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue!There's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates. Score: 8/10

												Pros: Free to play Base building  Crafting  Mild Farming  Large Maps  Workshop  Active dev  Multiplayer and Singleplayer  Vehicles you can drive, steal, and damage  Has a couple of wild, dangerous animals (bear/wolf)Neutral: Zombies (I like zombies but others may not) Blocky style (it's not bad, but sometimes it does look a bit silly)Cons: Other players (it's not always bad, but some people take the raiding too far) Possible cheating and/or people who abuse their power as the mod on a server  Kits and the like that turns the game into a spamfest  It's been a while for me, but I believe the Permanent Gold Upgrade also poses a mild issue. Where people with the upgrade can use their character slots as unraidable storage. Or when they die with one character, they can switch in their fully geared character to fight someone that beat them.TL;DR: The game has some mild issues, but it's free and has an extremely active dev that constantly updates the game. Probably the best free2play game I've ever played, that didn't make me feel like it was trying to leech out all my money and my soul.

								Okay as I've lately gained interest in this again since 2014 and I've played it a lot more, this is my review for ""Unturned"" (scroll to bottom for TL;DR)Things have improved A LOT since it's first release that I will list.- Map, the map is no longer ""Canada"" it is now still placed in Canada but now Prince Edward Islands which I have to say is a lot better than the Canada map. (imo)- Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills.- Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size.- Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice.There are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS.- Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles.- Vehicles, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2).- Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses. I doubt you'll run this game bad though.|x| Thanks for reading my review, If you have anything to ask me or want me to add, shoot a comment on this review. |x|TL;DR : Game has improved a lot over the course of a year and he's planning more like a new map set in america and a bunch of weapons.

								I loved this game, so fun. the fact that Nelson ties the community into the development well is awesome. during my 314.2 hours with this game, ive blown up more things than i can count. ive met some of my friends I now know from this game, and I never regret the moment i pressed play game, with the free to play mark next to that green button. if this game ever goes cash bought, i would buy it, and Im sure many of us players would too. keep up the great work Nelson, and do the do's that other f2p games have failed at.

								The term 'Free-to-Play' is slapped onto the side of a lot of games nowadays and it rarely lives up to expectations, with many of them carrying the undertone of 'Pay-to-Win'. With Unturned this isn't the case.The game is a completely free to play zombie survival game, there is an option to pay to upgrade this to a Gold membership however this is purely for aesthetic purposes - Newer/slick UI, extra character model customisations, Gold username displays on the in-game chat, you can also gain access to gold-member-only servers with a few % bonuses like exp and loot but this is a level playing field as you can only play with other Gold members with these bonuses.I don't wish to give much away about the gameplay but the game is awesome to play with friends and you can set up your own private servers fairly easily.There are a few bits and pieces that I feel could and most-likely will be improved in the near future:(There is currently a huge overhaul in development to the game so these points may/may not be valid once the update is live)The crafting system has pretty much zero guidance, and the recipes aren't exactly obvious. I don't like being spoon-fed but Stick + Bolts = Torch didn't occur naturally to me. The wiki contains everything you need to know about crafting.(Only in Player vs Environment) Once you have fortified, armed/equipped yourself, and have a steady income of growing crops the game becomes a lot less challenging - although I still manage to die in the simplest of situations... I would love to see roaming hordes on this game.At present the game only has one map, although the developer (The one developer working on this title) is in the process of creating a new Canada map.Hackers are a bit of a nuisance in online PvP servers.The above notes are just from my own personal take and experience of the game so far.These aside, I love the simple, blocky graphics, the open world feel, the insatiable appetite of your character - same goes for the zombies, the weapons and attachments, the survival mechanics, the trust issues, the uneasy silences, the countless naked respawns etc etc.I would really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys surviving with friends.

								The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a ""Blam"" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing. TL;DR: Play the game, don't play on severs with admins.

												There's been a lot of talk since November on the discussion boards involving uninformed consumers not understanding how this iteration of Total War works DLC-wise. For that reason, I'd like to take a second to tell you, the potential customer, what you're getting into, and why I still feel it's worth it.tl;dr at the bottom.What You Need to KnowThis game is expensive. A bit more than the DLC list lets on. In order to get the full experience out of this game, you need to own the prior Total War: Warhammer and its DLC as well. This allows you to play with the factions from the first game and the factions from the second game in a map encompassing both games in a campaign called ""Mortal Empires"". You do not need to have the first one installed to play its content in the second one, and you do not need to buy the blood pack again. They just leave that out of the initial release so they can market it as T for Teen. Take that, ESRB! But yeah, off-sale, at the time of this review (2/14/2018), you have to spend$213.90 USDto play the whole game. ""Sheesh,"" you must be thinking, ""That's a steep entry fee!"" Well, I doubt you buy games off-sale these days (I know I don't), and it's important to know that not all the DLC is necessary. You could get by spending $74.38 for 1 and 2 during a sale (TWWH2 usually goes 10% off and the original 50% off) and picking up the free-LC that came with the first installment. If you participated in Make War Not Love 2018, you received The Grim & The Grave DLC for the first installment free. If you want to play Greenskins in Mortal Empires, I'd recommend having The King and the Warlord as well, as it provides you with early-game armor-piercing units (Nasty Skulkers) and a lord tailored towards goblins, who are probably going to be a good chunk of your early armies (and, if you're Skarsnik, your armies through the entire game). That's all I usually use, since most of my hours clocked are on Bretonnia, a free faction from the first game. Even then, that's no small chunk of change, and it begs the question, ""Why is it so pricey?""Don't Blame the Developers, Blame the PublishersThis is probably the only way Sega agreed to make something so in-depth; anything less would've been either not funded or would've faced serious cuts in content. Keep in mind that the end goal is to put every tabletop faction from Warhammer Fantasy into the game as a fully-functional, playable faction. CA wanted to make the whole game, so they were forced to piece it out. By piecing it out, Sega could gauge interest (by the first one) and retention (by the second one), each time having the option to pull the plug if they thought continued investment would not be profitable.Does it suck? Yeah, strategy's a dying market, and while it's nice to see a big publisher at least try to give it attention, they want the results they see in other genres here. I've been lucky enough to receive most of the series as gifts; I've personally spent about $100 on it and have what is currently the full collection.Considering I've gotten almost 800 hours out of the two, I think that's a fair price (about $0.13/hr). I spent about that much on Warframe when I was into that, and my friends frequently drop that same amount on gacha games. Even divvied up like this, there's still some noticeable omissions, Mods make short work of that, though. Kislev, while primarily still an Empire reskin, can be led by Katarin the Ice Queen; Averland, by the Mad Count; Parravon, by Cassyon. The Southern Realms have a fairly high-profile rework that I'm partial to as well. Games have been partially developed due to time constraints for a long time, but modders always rise to the occasion. Unfortunately, one thing that doesn't seem to have a fix in the works is the fact that there is no naval combat. According to CA's representative on Reddit, Grace, ""Naval combat will only be in autoresolve. Warhammer Fantasy Battles is principally a game about land warfare, so that’s where we’re choosing to focus our efforts in terms of full battle simulation."" So if you were that one guy in Shogun 2 who got hyped every time his fleet got intercepted, this might not be for you.Why Support This, Then?I honestly believe CA has a strong passion for doing this franchise justice, despite everything that's been thrown at them. It shows in the little things, like the flavorful faction mechanics and the strikingly honest dev diaries. With how well this game is selling in revenue, judging by Steam's ""Best of 2017"" listings for ""Top Sellers"", I think this game is going to be supported for at least the next year or two, at which point it will continue to be supported partially in the form of Total War: Warhammer III's merger of 1, 2, & 3's maps and factions. Eventually, we'll have access to CA's dream from the start: every Warhammer Fantasy faction sharing a world together.GameplayOther people have probably said this better than I can. If you've played Total War, you'll adapt quick enough. Magic slaughters clumps, monsters fill an infantry support role similar to tanks in the 20th century, and the threat of death from above further pushes the ranged meta the series has always been a bit guilty of. Once they close in, though, melee fliers can tear through most archers, definitely meaning they're worth their salt.If you haven't played Total War, there's a turn-based strategic overworld where you make decisions for your faction (remember to build economy!) and, when your army encounters an opposing army or settlement, it becomes a real-time tactical battle where you control the units you amassed. Melee in the front, archers in the back, cavalry flanks from the sides or harasses the enemy. After the enemy's morale is shattered and they're routing, you've won! Or you can autoresolve and not spend a second in the field. Like a nerd.While I'm On My Soapbox...I would recommend adding Steel Faith Overhaul to your modlist, as it addresses some campaign map imbalances currently ailing Mortal Empires (anemic Dwarfs, off the top of my head) and provides a few new toys without bombarding you with a plethora of unbalanced options *cough*Radious*cough*. If you want more mod suggestions, click here to see what I use! Feel free to pick and choose! A man's mod setup is his self-expression, after all. I've also penned a comprehensive guide on playing Carcassonne, a Bretonnian subfaction, which you can find here! Now you too can tackle the least-played faction from the original game and turn them into crusader extraordinaires!tl;drGet Total War: Warhammer 1 when you get this one because Sega was cautious about this venture but Creative Assembly's trying their darndest anyways. Total War gets a bona fide fantasy makeover and it's gorgeous. SFO > Radious. Toodles!

												500 Hours deep and I still can not stop playing Vortex and Mortal Empires (the two solo/co-op) campaigns. I enjoyed lots of previous Total War games but was tired of them as so many were pikemen, swordsmen, bowmen, catapult, etc. With this you can play as Orcs, Dwarves, Ratmen, Beastmen, the wicked evil Chaos faction, and many more...  I still can not believe how well Warhammer assimilated into this game. It has EVERYTHING a fantasy lover would want in a total war game  and I can assure you I only knew Warhammer existed before this but on any kind of lore or races or characters, I was a total noob so you do not need to know lore or have access to volumes of Warhammer texts to get the feel for the world. There are good and bad elves. The dwarves hate the orcs. The vampires are really evil and hate men. The wood elves love nature... You get the kist of it already, do you not? *AND* If you so desire to learn about the lore of this world there are a lot of relly kind and generous youtubers who have made lore videos or play the game while talking of lore and I have to say that they are all not annoying and easy to listen to. (I find many streamers and youtubers insanely childish and can not bring myself to watch them no matter how much I want to see a game played or learn more about said game. But that is just me. XD )Add to this great environment really detailed level ups for your lords, AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL battlesites, and AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL campaign map, really spot on voice acting, AWESOME spells and effects.Dude if you are reading this then buy the game. You will not be disappointed.

												163 hours later, I've finally beaten this thing. It's a beast -- a sprawling grand strategy game full of nuance, lore, and emotionally engaging content. The AI is much smarter now. I had about a 100-hour learning curve, bouncing between different factions and trying different tactics until I really figured out how to play the game. This thing is amazing. I have to put it down for awhile so I can go get the million things done that I've been neglecting, but here are some pointers:1. Gain as much control of your continent as possible, as soon as possible. Make sure you can recruit some sort of troops anywhere in your empire, so you can quickly sprout new armies in the late game.2. Grab as many towns that produce your strategic game-winning resource (scrolls, tablets, etc...) as early as possible. Garrison these towns, and defend them.3. Station armies in your ritual sites before you start the ritual (bad guys show up fast), and have an additional army right outside the gate for reinforcements.4. Don't march armies of less than 20 units. Don't garrison armies of less than 20 units. As soon as you stretch yourself thin, this game devours you. It's better to march three armies from town to town than to try to take three towns with three armies in the same turn. 5. What I did, in provinces: Minor settlements: garrison building/economy building/growth Provincial Capitals: Specialty and military buildings.6. Have a plan. Your plan may vary, but here's a good plan: Reinforce the crap out of your starting continent. Once it's nice and fortified, go forth and conquer. It will cost a lot to invade another continent. Don't give in to the temptation to build a bunch of economy buildings in your newly conquered territories. You'll need to build new armies on these new continents, or you'll quickly get kicked back into the ocean. So build some recruitment buildings when you get there, and start up your economic expansion as soon as possible.7. Buying interventions to attack your enemies is expensive and not very effective, especially late in the game. What's more effective is to grab up as many strategic resource sites as possible, garrison them, keep armies there, and outpace the enemy to the end. That said, if the opportunity presents itself to take the other guy's capital city, it's very satisfying.8. It should go without saying, but skill up your generals to buff certain types of troops, and keep those types of troops in his or her army.9. Old Total War tricks don't work (for example: lay seige, retreat when the army inside sallies, army follows you and attacks out of range of reinforcements, you kill that army... yeah, that doesn't work anymore).10. Squishy troops stay squishy. Abandon all hopes of buffing up your weakest troops to someday be amazing. Build the highest level troops you can afford to build and maintain, and skill up your generals to buff them further.11. It's better to fight them over there, then to fight them over here! Keep your homeland heavily fortified (2-4 armies at your capital city, 2 for early game, 4 for late game). Maintain a robust economy, so that you can quickly field strong armies, and keep strong armies stationed around your continent. Once you've established the TWWH2 equivalent of Fortress America, send your armies to kill the bad guys on their own continents. Late in the game, I played a continuous game of take three colonies, lose one colony. It sucked losing colonies and generals, but it distracted the bad guys from attacking my homeland -- which they could've conquered if I hadn't have divided their focus.12. Don't forget to trade. Trade is awesome.13. Get rid of all troops and generals you don't need. Use the gold you save to build and deploy armies that are needed elsewhere.14. The game is very well balanced, so doomstacks (19 dragons, etc...) can lose to their tactical counterparts (spearmen, for example).15. Fighting Skaven sucks, because they constantly ambush constantly, and pick off your armies one at a time. You will love life a lot more late in the game if you just murder them all early in the game. Early on, they're pretty weak. If you let them take substantial territory and get a solid economic base, they'll become a huge pain in the butt. If you can kill them all early without fighting a war on two fronts (again, don't stretch yourself too thin), DO IT. They get truly awful later in the game.And that's all I've got. Good luck! It's a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.

												Total War: Warhammer II makes the entire Warhammer Fantasy Battles playing field even larger, combining with the first game into the grand campaign Mortal Empires as well as providing it's own grand campaign to boot.The game has been enhanced, the new races are absolutely fantastic and with the Vampire Coast and Tomb Kings this Total War title also received probably the very best DLCs of Total War History.There's nothing not to like about this.

												My most epic Total War: Warhammer moment: When my line of Chaos Chosen was about to charge into enemy line, one guy screamed “BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD”,and then the whole army continued “SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE”			 
				Posted: June 25
												Total War: Warhammer II is in my opinion the pinnacle of the Total War series. The first Warhammer game revolutionised the series with its new features. Previously, the historical Total War games had struggled with providing enough variety between factions. However, the Warhammer fantasy setting allowed for truly varied factions based on entirely different races with completely different rosters, providing so much more replay value. Lords and heroes with real skill trees, a robust magic system, and of course monsters of varying shapes and sizes also helped breath new life into what was, lets face it, a stagnating series prior to Warhammer. So Warhammer I was great sure, but is Warhammer II an improvement? Oh absolutely. Warhammer II isn't the cherry on top of the cake that was its predecessor, its more delicious cake. Everything that Warhammer I did well, Warhammer II does even better. The new races have much more detailed and unique features and bonuses, and as a result they almost make you feel like you're playing different games. The skill trees, rosters, and events have been fleshed out even more. Everything has been supercharged. However, what makes Warhammer II stand out as I think the best RTS available right now are the campaigns. Firstly, the 'Eye of the Vortex' campaign gives you a goal to strive towards, a true endgame; a first for Total War grand campaigns. In previous Total War campaigns I would find myself eventually growing bored of the campaign I was playing. I would eventually reach a point where I was so powerful that it would no longer be fun. The periodical 'rituals' in the Vortex campaign completely fix that issue. Now there is not only an objective to strive towards, but also much more challenge in the late game. Of course you can ignore the rituals and the story if you so choose, but it makes the campaign so much more fun and interesting so I'm not sure why you would. Then we come to the second campaign, Mortal Empires. Mortal Empires is essentially the Old World map from the original Total War Warhammer, with the New World and all of its factions added to it to create one huge campaign map. It. Is. Huge. This campaign also provides the more traditional sandbox style campaign without the Vortex rituals and such, though there is still the Chaos invasion in the late game. So what you end up with is everything you loved about the first game, with all of the new features and factions added in to create a wonderfully huge campaign. Another thing to note is that Creative Assembly have been so much better at providing new content in a more consumer friendly way this time around too. The paid-for DLC packs are now more focused on fleshing out existing factions or providing new ones; as per request, and ever since the launch of the game there has been a steady stream of free new content in the form of new game modes, new factions, and new multiplayer maps. So clearly the developers have learned a lot. So in conclusion, I absolutely adore this game, even more so than the original. I didn't know or care about the Warhammer Fantasy Battles universe at all before Total War Warhammer, but two games later: I'm obsessed. I've been a fan of the Total War series since the original Rome: Total War, and I can confidently and enthusiastically say that I truly believe Total War: Warhammer II to be the best yet by far.10/10Not only the best Total War game, but possibly the best RTS in general too.

												Total War: Warhammer II is the direct sequel to Warhammer I, and along with it, brings in a multitude of improvements from the previous title.The game takes place across four continents, Ulthwan, Naggaroth, The Southlands, and Lustria, each having it's own host of varied climates, unique building chains and factions. Furthermore, each of these continents bring along an individual, unique faction. The four playable factions being the High Elves, Dark Elves, Lizardmen and Skaven.Coming from a Total War perspectiveWarhammer II, similarly to Warhammer I, reminds me of the classic Rome I and Medieval II games, removing the one to one combat held in previous titles and replacing it with what we saw in the older titles, leading to a more varied and exciting combat. Cavalry charges are incredible and really do show off what more powerful cavalry units such can do, ripping through lines of enemies, potentially changing the outcome of the battle.ContentThis is probably the most asked question regarding newer Total War games, and with confidence, I can say that this game definitely offers a large amount of content. The Great Vortex campaign is a large change from the standard domination type victories from previous total war games and the introduction of newer races such as the lizardmen provide a breath of fresh air from the standard spearmen, archers and cavalry, with each race providing a unique way to fight each battle and make their way through the campaign, one example would be how the High Elves rely on more expensive units whereas the Skaven relies on hordes and numbers.Improvements from the first gameWarhammer II definitely takes a step in the right direction in regards to improvements from the first game, feedback has been taken in from the community, with inspiration taken from popular mods such as heroes in higher end garrisons and the ability to colonise anywhere, instead adding penalties such as negative public order when occupying climates that are not suitable for the race. Bridge battles have been added back and the campaign map has been extended to add treasure hunts, rites to buff your faction and specific abilities to each faction, high elves using influence to increase or decrease relations between factions, leading to yourself gaining the upper hand in diplomacy. Furthermore, minor settlement battles, while still fought on the open field, have been improved with new models that have been added to make it look as if it is outside a settlement, leading to a more aesthetically pleasing battle.Graphics, soundtrack, user interfaceThe graphics have been improved from the first game in regards to lighting, effects and textures, though nothing too dramatic that I can notice. The campaign map has especially been improved, with different regions looking exceptional, reminding me of some the improvements some of the mods made to Warhammer I's campaign lighting.The soundtrack is memorable, unique to different races and can really provide an epic feeling to the campaign and battles, credit must definitely be given to the artists such as RIchard Beddow, a massive improvement from previous titles such as Rome II.Lastly, the user interface. While it, of course, retains may of the features from the previous titles, CA has gone out of their way to add improvements that were, not especially needed, though definitely great to have, most notably the ability to change camera settings, designating different speeds for neutral, warring and allied factions. Events are no longer required to be opened up to be seen, though hovering over them in the panel leading to the information being shown and the ability the zoom in directly from the campaign map to an overview are all welcome improvements from the first game.FutureI am especially excited for the future of this game, with newer factions, units and improvements being added in time. No content has been locked behind a paywall such as Chaos for Warhammer I and I personally am excited for new content releasing in DLC, to prolonge the life and my playthrough of this game. Moreover, the well anticipated Mortal Empires expansion, free to users of both games, will combine both maps, introducing new mechanics such as ""rogue armies, ranged breath-attacks for all dragons, treasure hunting, encounters at sea, storms, shallows and reefs, a whacking great number of UI refinements and improvements, 8 and 10-slot cities, chokepoint maps and, of course, universal territory capture and climate suitability mechanics."" and increasing the amount of settlements from 142 from the first game to 295 in both games, leading to an extremely large campaign map to conquer.Room for ImprovementsDiplomacy, while improved still requires some tweaking, with factions on the edge of destruction still refusing peace, trade agreements for both parties offering great positives still being turned down being two of the most frustrating. I have also come across one settlement factions fielding 4 armies at once, with no units, thus, were running away and raising more whenever I destroyed one. The AI, while great in battle, could also use some improving on the campaign map, the introduction of the ability to not retreat while in forced march and instantly destroying the army, similarly in a garrison is great, though the AI seems to use force march to stand right in front of your armies, therefore giving you the ability to wipe it out in one fell swoop. Another criticism are the siege battles, they are similar to the first game and thus are similarly, quite boring and sometimes infuriating. Towers still have unlimited range and thus are able to destroy your most valuable units before reaching the walls, one side to attack leads to less strategy involved and overall, makes sieges more of an autoresolve than actually leading.Playing the game some more, I have decided to update this slightly with the fact that siege battles, both in Mortal Empires and in the vortex campaign, are very easily exploitable. This is performed in one main way in which you stick your lord or heroes in front of any artillery, infantry, etc. you have available, and the towers thus prioritise your lord, heroes, taking minimal damage while your artillery break down the towers, thus giving any ranged units you have a chance to pick off the enemies, eventually leading to a mass rout when they lose enough. This is most prevalent when playing as the High Elves, Dark Elves, but also works with the Empire, Dwarves, and any army that has capable ranged units. Though I try to avoid using this strategy, it still shows the TW: Warhammer siege battles need some work.ConclusionWhile Total War: Warhammer II does definitely require some improvements in regards to diplomacy, sieges and the AI for example, it is still an extremely fun and interesting game, adding in new improvements and leading to an overall worth buy in my opinion.*I will hopefully be extending/adding into this review as the game develops.

												Well, having been played nearly 200 hours in WH1 and 110 hrs+ in WH2, I would like to share some of my experience with the general gaming community.Experience in WH1:First of all, why would I mentioned the game in first title of the trilogy? Well, it's because the map in WH1 was stitched into WH2 under the massive campaign called Mortal Empire (ME). My initial experience in WH1 was great as I was pumped to be exposed to the warhammer world which I have never even heard of. I was amazed with all the sieges, underpass, field battles, cavalry charges and so on. But after like 50+ hrs, things get boring after you have tried most of the races and there seems to be nothing new anymore. The event triggered gets pretty routine and predicted, the game wasn't dynamic at all. But still it is a decent game.Don't get me wrong though, I still hate Creative Assembly for charging us the fee on the Blood and Gore graphic effects.Experience in WH2:Man the vortex campaign, that was exciting. Four major races clashing together to control the god damn whirling vortex on a continent called Ulthuan. I was so excited that I even get my graphic card upgraded from gtx 950 to gtx 1070 to fully enjoy the ultra graphic settings. The event was unpredicted, traits on lords and heroes gained are based on actions taken, the ocean is not dull anymore when its fill with treasures and attrition as well (except that there is still no naval battle, meh). Each continents where the 4 major races rest has its unique weather and terrain effect. Though that I am more than happier in WH2 than WH1, it is not without any cons. The capitals model is not distinct enough, for example, the two legendary lords starting capital on the similar race looks the same. There is not much challenge after you completed the vortex, the buffs are just too epic. I also dislike the fact that I can't have the legendary lords of the race you confederate with, which is a massive meh for me.Mortal Empires:Now this is the craziest stuff I have ever heard of. The idea was brilliant the game studio combine the map from the first and second title of the game. I will not discredit CA just because they have some bugs here and there. I mean come on guys, they gave you the extra campaign to spend another hundreds of gaming experience here for free. They could have just walked away after the vortex campaign and move on to the third title of the trilogy, or even get you to put in some bucks for the extra features. If you don't get what I mean, just head back to WH1.I can't complain.Overall, well done CA.

												Total War Warhammer 2 is the latest game in the epic grand strategy franchise. Set in the fantasy version of the Warhammer universe, the player can choose to play as one of four races – High Elves, Dark Elves, Lizardmen and Skaven (giant rats) – as they battle over control of a magical vortex.The vortex is basically a barrier, preventing the forces of Chaos from invading the world. Some factions are trying to save the world, while others want to cause the End Times. As is usual for Total War, gameplay is divided into two major sections. The turn based campaign map is where you focus on the big picture, empire wide tasks. Train armies, move them around the map, capture and defend settlements, research technologies, construct buildings to improve your economy and public happiness, forge trade agreements and military alliances with other factions. Then fight large scale battles involving thousands of soldiers in real time. And by soldiers, I’m not just talking about your standard swordsmen, spearmen, archers and cavalry. The fantasy setting provides a wide variety of unusual creatures including giant eagles, phoenixes, dragons, hydras, rat ogres, hell pit abominations and many more.This is the fourth Total War game I’ve played, after Shogun 2, Rome 2 and the original Warhammer. After spending almost 50 hours playing through the High Elf campaign, I can confidently say that TWW2 is easily the best version, building on what was good about the previous games, and improving in several ways.The most obvious improvement is how the vortex affects the campaign. I was never really comfortable with the victory conditions in any of those previous Total War games. They usually required you to control a certain number of settlements, and sometimes eliminate a specific faction. I often felt like I ended up going to war with factions that I didn’t really consider to be my enemy, just to expand far enough to satisfy the victory conditions.In order to gain control of the vortex and win the campaign, the four main races need to collect resources to perform five rituals. Each controlled settlement provides a small amount of resources, but some settlements in specific locations provide a larger amount. This means you don’t necessarily need to have the biggest empire to win. Each ritual takes place in three of your settlements simultaneously, and you’ll have to defend them for ten turns until the ritual completes. Starting a ritual will allow some Chaos armies to pass through the vortex, with the intention of destroying ritual sites. And the four races can always see each other’s ritual progress, so this naturally triggers conflict between them, especially in the later stages.In my High Elves campaign, things were looking good at the halfway stage, as I was first to complete the third ritual. I was intending to stay defensive for the rest of the campaign, but after a while I noticed the Dark Elves had pulled in front after a period of aggressive expansion. This forced me to start an invasion of their lands to slow them down. The Lizardmen had the same idea as me, so the Dark Elves got pushed back quite far. At one point I thought that the Skaven were going to sneak a win while everyone else was fighting each other. Then one of my allies destroyed a Skaven ritual site, giving me a clear run to victory. It really felt like every faction was involved in an epic world war.The world map is quite varied, from the frozen wastes of the north, to the Elves’ mountainous island, to the tropical jungles and deserts in the south. There are many minor races scattered around, including vampires, dwarves, bretonians, greenskins and wood elves. Any race can now claim any settlement (the previous game had some annoying restrictions), but will suffer penalties to growth, economy and army replenishment if the climate isn’t desirable. You’re also encouraged to explore the seas, as you can often find shipwrecks containing treasure which could include extra gold, weapons/armour to equip on your generals and temporary buffs for your soldiers in combat.The AI was good in the previous game, but another improvement in TWW2 is that the AI will attack the player more often on the battlefield instead of always just sitting back and waiting for you to come at them.Each faction can also spend gold to perform rites (different to rituals) which give temporary factionwide buffs. For example, the High Elves have a rite which makes armies immune to attrition (soldiers dying while travelling through bad weather conditions), which is perfect when attacking enemy settlements in harsh/corrupted environments.Each of the main races has a unique mechanic which makes their playing style different to the others. The High Elves are the only one that I can talk about as I haven’t played as the other races yet – they get bonuses to diplomacy through a political intrigue system. Periodically you’ll encounter multiple choice scenarios, and your decisions will result in gaining or losing influence, as well as other temporary factionwide effects. Influence can then be spent to improve your relationship with another faction, or to damage the relationship between two of your enemies.In the early part of my campaign, I was frequently being attacked by two minor factions, the Skaeling and the Pirates of Sartosa. Using influence, I was able to make peace with Sartosa, convince them to declare war on the Skaeling, and then I made an alliance with Sartosa and pushed the Skaeling back, completely wiping them out. My only complaints with this mechanic is that there aren’t many different scenarios, so I encountered frequent repeats, and they often referred to the leaders of other Elven factions that had long since been eliminated.Total War Warhammer 2 is an absolute masterpiece, and I’ve loved every minute of it. Its going to get my vote for best game of 2017. If you’re a fan of Total War, or strategy games in general, Warhammer 2 is an essential purchase. Considering the length of the campaign, and the variety of playable factions, you won’t regret a full price purchase.

												I just spent 9 hours playing this the first day I got it. Purchashed both games so I could do the Mortal epic map.Anyway, this does not happen to me. I play games for 15 minutes at a time. Not an hour, certainly not HOURS. I know other people do. I just don't normally have the attention span and games don't keep me interested that long. However...-""I'll play as the vampire lords.""-""Oh, I really want to squash those other vampire lords and consolidate my kingdom. That should be fun.""- Hours later-""Well I've consolidated my kingdom. I am the one supreme Vampire Lord. Oh look, kingdoms of Man to the west...""- Hours later- ""I've overextended my legions and now share a border with something called the Empire. Better spread my vampiric corruption throughout their lands in preparation for invasion.""- Hours later- ""THE EMPIRE SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE VAMPIRE LORDS!""What's great is, I think this is exactly how the developers intended this game to go. Small focus to bigger focus to enormous focus. I love it.Halfway through the session I begrudgingly began trading with the dwarven holds to my East. They got fat and powerful off our arrangement and I feared they would try something, but then a veritable tsunami of Greenskins hit them from the south and are in the process of turning them into dwarf chitlins.Great game, guys.

												Money grubbing game designers don't know the difference between microstransactions for skins and pay to play for people who want a SINGLE PLAYER experience. Stop making your players skill based on how much money you put into the game. I literlaly hate NBA 2k now and I have been a loyal fan since it was on Dreamcast. Get your act together.			 
				Posted: September 15
												Maybe they could make a fun career mode if they didn't focus on their stupid microtransactions. I don't care about my park, and I don't want to spend a bunch of money to bring my character to a point where I don't feel like a high school athlete playing in the nba. I wish this stupid microtransction trend with sports game would just go away.---------------------edit: Stay far away from this franchise. There was no love involved making this game. It's a soulless money grab. The love for basketball I have is not shared by the developers of this game.			 
				Posted: October 17
												Hot damn. This game is two extremes. There's just no in-between. It's the best basketball game I've ever played, and also one of the most frustrating. It's incredible in every sense of the word.On one hand, the gameplay is freaking stellar. To say it's the best basketball game I've ever played (i.e the actual on-court gameplay) is understating it... it's just absolutely great. The gameplay itself, the in-game presentation, the graphics... it's just gorgeous.On the other hand, so much of the rest of it is hot garbage. The microtransaction issue has been discussed plenty, and yeah: that sucks. It really makes what should be a really awesome game mode feel like a chintzy cash grab. And generally speaking many of the menu systems are a convoluted mess. But those aren't even its biggest problems. Because even with all of that, I would still be recommending this game. Just based on gameplay alone, it's great. Personally, I love playing franchise mode on sports games, so the whole microtransaction headache really doesn't come into play for me. The menu headaches I can deal with once I figure out the system.But! The game's so freaking buggy, I keep losing save files to corruption. As someone who likes to play franchises over long periods of time, that renders this game more or less useless to me until its fixed. And it's not like this is a launch day issue: this thing's been out over a month now. And a quick perusal of forums and blogs and etc shows I'm not the only one having this problem, and there's no shortage of other bugs being reported--and 2k is apparently so swamped with tech support requests they're taking over a week to reply, if they're replying at all. Don't waste your money. I saw the $40 sale and thought ""what the heck,"" but honestly, 2k doesn't deserve your money.Editing this to add experiences after a couple of months in the game: my impressions haven't changed overall. It's the best and worst thing ever.The myPlayer microtransaction moneygrab thing... honestly, if they'd like made it SLIGHTLY easier, less grindey, it would be awesome. As it is, you pretty much have to spend $10-20. If you do that, the game's fine. If you don't? It's a slog. Your player will suck for a really long time, and improving is a slow and painful process. You really have to grind.But hey, at least your myCareer save file doesn't corrupt... unlike franchise save files, which they still haven't fixed. For me, franchise files have corrupted, no joke, 9 out of 10 times. That's out of 10 times I tried to start a franchise, 9 of them corrupted the first time I saved and closed the game then opened it up again. (The one time it didn't the first time, it corrupted the second time I saved and re-opened. WOOOOO.) Contacting 2K support was a joke. I sent them as much system and error info as I could, and it took them 2 weeks just to send me a clearly-automated form email giving me troubleshooting tips... for a console. Like... you have to work to be that bad. And no, your ""we're sorry we're so slow we're buried under emails from people who hate this game"" is not a good excuse, but thanks for playing. Honestly, I just remain amazed by this game. For the on-court experience, it's the best basketball game I've ever played, and maybe the best sports game I've ever played. But literally everything else--the bugs, the laughably bad menus, the money, the painfully bad customer service, etc--has pretty much convinced me to never give 2K a dime again.One final edit: I finally got the save files working. I don't think it was anything 2k19 did; if you search for some combination of ""2k19 file corruption"" you'll find a thread on the Steam community forums pointing you to where the save files are located; I followed that advice and got it working. So now I'm playing my franchise mode and I'm overally pretty happy.I'm still not recommending this game, because holy crap, I shouldn't have to fix your bugs for you.

												I AM SO TIRED of 2k getting away with this pay to win microtransaction system. its frustrating to play this game without buying the 100$ edition or investing ATLEAST 20$ to get to an enjoyable point of the game where it would takes HOURS ON HOURS to get to. I played most 2ks reliogously but have found a building resentment for this series and its microtransactions.RIP 2K.DO NOT BUY UNTIL ITS ON SALE NOT WORTH IT,

												Gambling and pay2win is not ok, stop it alreadyAnother year another sports game. So I’ll start by saying that I’m not going to give a positive review for a game which has the most blatant pay2win model, gambling and selling cheats.NBA 2k19 is an improvement over the last game. You may not notice that by just watching videos, but when you spend some time playing it you see it’s quite different.Graphics are pretty much the same, maybe players look a little better. But some player are like from PS2 era. I know that making every player look god is a long and difficult job, but with releasing the game every year and getting insane profits each year it’s possible to do.Animations are nice and this time game relies less on them. It is still animation based, but now you have more control over your player.Another improvement which I consider the biggest one is when you’re open you’re really open. No more just standing behind the player who shoots and it registered as contested shot. You must stand in front of the player and put your hands up to contest the shot. So finally you can pass the ball to an open player and shoot right away while defending man is behind you or on the side or just standing in front of you but does nothing to contest. Unfortunately this has a downside. Because it’s really easy to get open shots, the game may become three point shooting contest.Defense is improved too. You still drive to the basket, but often it ends with a “climbing into the tree” than a successful layup. So it’s better to rely on other way to score. Defense is much more effective this year.I had no problems with performance, game runs fine on max settings and looks great.I play MyTeam and MyCareer mode mainly. Both are p2w and infested with cheaters. The game has no anticheat. They only ban cheaters who cheat the currency.MyTeam this time is better and worse at the same time. It’s better because you can get some decent players at the beginning and if you know the game you can be pretty competitive. They have added tokens this year which you can earn by simply playing the game, online and offline, then use those tokens to purchase player cards. And to be honest you can get a lot of ruby cards for cheap from the auction just for a few thousand MT each, so building a competitive team is pretty fast.Now why it is worse? The auction is locked. To unlock it you MUST win and online triple threat(3vs3) game. This was possible at day one when most people had poor player cards, but it’s impossible to do if you bought the game later when everyone has the best players already. There are two outcomes to this – you either spend money on VC to buy good player cards or you simply don’t play MyTeam, because without an auction it’s pointless.And again like any other year there are cheaters who if losing just makes the game not count. Of course this doesn’t involve cheating VC so 2K doesn’t care, they doesn’t care about bad experiences, glitches or bug, but if VC glitch is discovered they patch it in a few days.Now another thing about MyTeam. I know it’s fun to build your team of super stars, but in the end it’s boring. Everyone has the best players, everyone has almost the same players. Every player can shoot mid-range, dunk or three-pointers. And it’s no fun either you win or lose. I wish we could have a separate mode(or this done in the current unlimited mode) where we would be forced to use some crappy cards, like bronze, silver, gold, emerald. This would force people to use each player’s strength’s and for opponent to find the weaknesses, this would make people to think, to plan, in other words to play basketball like it supposed to be played. Now we have every player good at everything which isn't fun.MyCareer is awesome if you play single player. Finally we’ve got some nice story mode. Last year I wanted to skip all the cut-scenes because it was boring. This year we can skip them, but I don’t want to do that, because are very well done and are interesting to watch. I wish some rpg games had facial animations so good. You start as a player in a Chinese basketball league and make your way up to NBA. You can see how your player struggles, how hard he’s working and wants to get into NBA. Really good job 2K.To make your player better you must earn VC and upgrade him. And with the ability to buy VC we all know where it leads when it comes to online play.Of course there are many more modes in this game. There’s a lot of content for both single player and multiplayer. There’s an online mode “Play now” which isn’t affected by p2w mechanics so you can enjoy that at least and know if you win or lose it was only because of your skill.In conclusion I recommend to buy this game but don’t buy any VC, I mean any, not even one time, not even the cheapest option. Doing this we show them that the game is good but we are not ok with p2w and gambling.Pros:Improved gameplayGood graphicsLots of content for both single player and multiplayerMyCareer mode is greatCons:Gambling and pay2win bsSome players look really badNo anti-cheatLocked auction in MyTeamMy curator page

												Do not buy this game!  She's only been out for a week and there are already cheaters on it.  If you played 2k18 and noticed cheaters..... guess what they all came over to 2k19.  What an embarrassment that a $60 AAA title ships AGAIN with no anti cheat.  Just one dudes opinion, take it for what it's worth			 
				Posted: November 10
												I have waited a few years before posting a review on a NBA 2K game, I mean 2K18 was pretty bad with B-fresh but the worst part of 2K16-2K17-2K18 and now 2K19 is they refuse to add any sort of anti-cheat or report system to allow us to report cheaters and get them removed from the multiplayer aspect. . if you try to report them via steam forums they will censor and delete your posts, sometimes ending in getting banned from the steam forums, yes they will treat you horribly for trying to report cheaters that are ruining your gameplay by hacking. There has been many obvious pictures, videos and evidence lurking everywhere, yet they censor it very quickly and delete it all like nothing happened. . what this means is that not only are they allowing the cheaters to bully us, their being protected by 2K because they wont allow us to properly report them or do anything about them. Theres also that video of the Developer who set his in-game player to Max Hall of Fame badges on a Pure Sharpshooter, 24 Hall of Fame Badges... when they can only a max of 5 on that build. Very cool also they deleted and didnt allow that to be posted either of course they dont want that shame I suppose on top of allowing cheaters to destroy their in-game multiplayer community. At least their adding A.I to the game for the cheaters to easily beat instead of farming us like sheep.Pros:- Gameplay is fun, its a good basketball game and single player is fun.Cons:- Massive cheating allowed.- Censorship like its 1930-50's Russia, they kill your post if you show any evidence of cheating or exploiting.- Spend tons of VC on Tattoos only to have them disappear and unequip off your players.- Huge cash grab.- Random crashes and disconnects, followed by lag during some of their events.- Lots of bugs they could easily fix if they listened to their community.- Trivia nonsense - theres only 15,000-16,000 Active players on Steam for NBA 2K19 yet when your doing Trivia theres 40-60k players, that means they must be linked to CROSS PLATFORM with their Xbox and PS4 servers, why dont they then allow us to play with them players aswell so they can feel cheated and abused like the PC players since we have to share Trivia with them?I highly recommend staying away from 2K games until they actually start caring about the players they provide game services for.

												Where to start with this piece.......... (TLDR: Stay Away)Microtransactions are still there, and the company is begging EU players to ask legislation to keep them. The player control feels like you're playing super monkey ball sometimes or a boat (sometimes unable to make tight turns or stay on D). The park on release day was sparsely populated and to top it all off there is no anti-cheat software what-so-ever. Every video on YouTube before the game released had nothing bad to say about it and the reviews were blocked on steam until today. I’ve bought every NBA since 2k12 but will not again. I mistakenly bought the game because it honestly looked good on Chris Smoove’s playthrough. Save your cash because I feel for anyone who wasn't able to get a refund.			 
				Posted: September 11
												As much as I would like it to give it a Thumbs Up review.I can't. Game still do not have any anti-hacker/anti-cheater system which is a must for an online competitive game like this. So Expect cheaters/hackers on its online modes.For those who are planning to buy and play online. You have been warned!			"

								To me DayZ will always be that beautiful concept that never came to be.It was such a great project since the release of the mod, then the standalone got announced everyone got so hyped, I bought it when it first came out, met a bunch of friends ingame, we were always discussing how much stuff we were going to do once the game got fully released, but in the meantime we became adults, we lost contact with each other, got job, university... To me DayZ will always be the game which development was slower than my own adolescence.I honestly believe it's time to place a stone on this mess and move on,so please,do not buy this game thinking that it will one day become something.Because DayZ, was, is, and always will be stuck at DayZero.

													Early Access ReviewThis ""game"" sets a perfect example of how to do everything wrong in software development(Disclaimer: I'm a software engineer myself)(UPDATE) I never thought this would get so much attention. Before you read the rest of this review, please keep in mind that this - like any other review out there - represents my _opinion_ about this game and mine alone. Since the game is still in development, my criticism is mostly pointed towards the acutal development of this game rather than the game itself. There might be a one in a 1000 chance that I might change this review around by the time the game gets officially released.With a sum of almost 590 hour in this game, I've given up hope on this. We (my family) started playing about 2 years ago and it really wasn't bad back then. Of course there were bugs, things were incomplete, but that's to be expected from an Early Access game.However, as I've been closely monitoring the development progress of the game, I see so many things going wrong in the development team, I almost feel the urge to take a plane, fly there and put some people in their place and teach them a thing or two about priorities.It's been almost two and a half years since the release on steam, the game is far worse than it was 2 years ago. In a long period of time, Bohemia managed to keep implementing 'content' to keep the players happy, while they should've been working on engine-related systems instead. Now they have to ""refactor"" every single piece of content to make it fit with the 'new engine'. As an engineer myself, I know how much time and effort this takes. The person responsible for prioritizing content over enigne should be fired and never to be allowed in game development again.If you follow the development updates on their forums (forums.dayzgame.com), you might notice that the team works in an agile method using 'sprints'. We do the same in our office. However, usually there is one person responsible for prioritizing tasks and planing them ahead. This person clearly thinks from a business perspective instead of something to improve the quality of life of the software (maintainability, easy-adopting and stability), and it hurts me to see this happen to a studio like this.While DayZ started the 'hype' of zombie/survival-games, a lot of much better alternatives got released in the meantime. I'm not here to advertize or suggest anything in particular since I gave up on these types of games after the horrible taste in my mouth that this game gave me.Just to sum up some highlights of the things that happened in the past 2 years: Dean Hall left. No more proper leadership. Brian Hicks took over. Content was released that needed total refactorization for the new engine (who the hell thought this was a good idea?) Looking at the speed things are being implemented/fixed, I'm guessing there is less than a handful of actual programmers on the team. Loot tables got completely messed up. It still isn't fixed. Central Economy? Who thought this up? Server side programming is utterly horrible! Lag doesn't even begin to describe the rubberbanding/desynchronisation  happening in this game. Lastly; Somebody messed up the entire world (height shifts in entire sections of the grid, floating/flying buildings, etc.)Especially the last point of the list above dazzles me. They have an internal testing process. They have an experimental process. Who in their right mind would push these things to a production environment? If you introduce a bug like that (which isn't a byproduct of a feature but just a complete and utter f*ck-up), you bloody FIX IT.So, to answer the question if I would recommend this game to ANYONE:The answer is NO. No you shoulnd't. Go spend your money on something more useful like a tray of sodapops or some food for the coming week. If anyone of Bohemia reads this, here's the proper way to ""port"" a game to a different engine: - Find a game to port (in this case, the DayZ mod for Arma II) - Build a new Engine for your game to begin with - you already knew the limitations of Arma when you guys started. - FINISH THE ENGINE! - Build a toolset for designers and artists to populate the game with content. - Once you have a MVP (Minimal Viable Product), go early access, AND NOT BEFORE THAT! - Go fix bugs, implement content - finish the game.Apparently, people with absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in software engineering in general had leadership over the development of this ""game"".In all seriousness though, big kudos to the team that's been there since day one. All the negative crap they get over themselves right now would completely ruin any form of motivation to even keep working on the game for me.This was my first review. Thanks for reading.

								EDIT:  READ UPDATE AT THE ENDIf you loved the mod, you will love this. Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.Your main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.OK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!! Alright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming ""HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!"" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. Is that some fruit on the ground? Oh lucky day! Pick up the fruit, dust off the mold, and take a bite. Feeling a little sick? It's probably nothing. Just keep moving...You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You find a barn with some steps.You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You look up to find another newly spawned user who is disoriented but has a cool hat. You look down and find an axe. Now you have a cool hat and two sets of clothes, batteries, and flashlights..._________________________________________________________________Update as of June 5, 2014.Thank you to all of you who have commented and voted on my review so far.  I have noticed a few similar questions and comments being repeatedly posted, so I am going to address some here.1.  Does this game require ArmA II?  No, it is a standalone game, which is different than the mod, that requires no other purchases.  When you buy the game, you can start playing immediately and after the full release.2.  Will this game come out for the Mac?The system requirements on the store page list the following operating systems: Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7 SP1._________________________________________________________________Update as of June 5, 2015.It's been a year since my last update and I felt it was time to do another one.Not much has changed with the game and that has been greatly disappointing.  It came out with such promise but time passed and I have been soured over the fact that so little work has been done to it.  What happened, devs?  Is anyone working on it anymore?  Did you stop caring?  It sort of feels like you took the money and ran.  It saddens me because I still love the game but I cannot heartily recommend it like I once did.Looking to buy this game?  Do your homework first.  Read the reviews.  If you don't mind an incomplete game, go for it.  Otherwise you'd be wise to save your money for another game.I am keeping my original review up for now._________________________________________________________________Update as of September 11, 2016.I've had this game for over two years now and extremely little progress has been made.  The latest patches have left the game more buggy and difficult to play.  This was obviously abandoned all the way to the bank.  I am leaving my ""funny"" review up but I cannot in good faith recommend this any longer.

WHAT THE HELL.edit:Wow, so much hate coming in, the comment section is full with people telling me that I don't know how game development works.At Slumdog Millionaire movie, there's this scene where a rich guy gives a bottle of coke to some poor Indian kids living in poverty. These kids are so happy because they've never drunk coke before. You can make poor people happy with small things, because by default they are poor so their needs are obviously much less than a regular person. The regular DayZ player plays DayZ in poverty as well, a poverty of updates. This is how Bohemia keeps their players ""happy"", they give us small updates. Updates which take 6 months to finish and don't bring much new things to the game.. I was also one of these people. Bohemia sold 2.5million or maybe even more copies for this game. That's more than $60 million. They promised us Beta on 2015 Q4, we didn't get it. They said they wanted to change the game engine, it took their full year. They said the game will be on Play Station, but that's nowhere to be heard. They said they'll add basebuilding 2 years ago, it's not here. They said they'll add injury system, blood on hands when you skin an animal/human. Pooping, marijuana smoking, making the altar radio station fully fledged. Helicopters, bikes, motorbikes, car functioning and maintenance, full damage system for vehicles, stamina and endurance, realistic animal AI. They added wolves, but they can do 180 degree spins while you're running from them. They said they'll make all building floors enterable, they said they'll put vegetation all around the walls of the buildings. They said they will make the Tisy military base contaminated. They said they'll improve zombie AI. They said they'll add zombie hoardes, where are they? Where's the character soft skills? Where's the planes? Character lifespan? Visible scars? They promised us the player controller and new animation system to come around the summer of 2016 or the end 2017, but they still didn't implement it yet. Improved crafting system that allowed us to live off our lives in the wild WITHOUT visiting the cities etc. If I want to pitch a tent, I still need to run around the forest to find a place that both my character can fit in and put a tent. They promised a new tent placement system (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hSGduQ7YE ) they said they'll add it in 3 months. They didn't. Here in the Trello you can see what they have in ""progress"" with the exact dates they've been added and have an overall idea what I'm talking about: https://trello.com/b/5yzeFpo2/dayz The list goes on.You can see their old status reports here: https://dayz.com/blog/ please scroll all the way down to 2015 era and see what they promised to us.I'm an experienced DayZ player, I both played SA and topped lots of hours of play on the mod. Sure, this is a fun game. But I don't recommend it to any friend that asks me. If you're not patient as much as I am, this game is not for you. I still play this time to time, but let's be honest. An open alpha game, that made a revenue of 60million, a huge company like Bohemia, can't complete the alpha stage prior to its release, IN 3.5 YEARS? There's something wrong there. Maybe it was Dean Hall, maybe it's with the dev team. But you can clearly say something is wrong there. People are telling me that Beta is soon, you should take a look at the status reports that said beta was soon, around 189318 million times before. I remember them saying on twitter that they don't want to rush beta, so it will be on version 0.81 (current version is 0.62 and they said 0.63 will be beta) We've never been this close to beta before.They said it will be soon, by soon they probably mean 2036 or something. Considering we are not hit by an astreoid by then. lol. If they hit ""beta"" with the current speed they are developing, it is possible that they'll either release an incomplete game and continue developing after the full release, which is probably okay for most people. Or the game will take another 3 years to complete.edit 2:ohh btw, I just remembered. There's another excuse they say, ""alpha is for adding features you dumb ♥♥♥♥""Very good point. Where are the features that they were supposed to add on Alpha? Will they add them all on Beta? Alpha means adding features, Beta is where these features are improved and the bugs are fixed. If they don't add the features they promised on Alpha then they'll continue adding these core features in the Beta phase which means then we'll be likely to see an Alpha-like Beta. Where they continue adding the features they promised years ago.Finally, I hope I'm wrong with all this and the DayZ dev team steps up their game. If they do, I'll surely delete this review.			"

								Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake).Terraria was fun, I enjoyed the additional combat focus. DayZ didn't have 'it' for me, I didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)Ark was fun (dinos!), but it got stale as there was no forced conflict. No reason to explore, no reason to keep building. So it fell into the minecraft trap.7 Days to Die allows me to be creative, but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building. Not only that, but it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion.This was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale, and I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break. Strongly recommend!

								One of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Die, hands down, maybe even my absolute favorite.Whenever I try out a game, I dont play it for three or four hours before rating it, you're barely into a game to even rate it, in my opinion. At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am.Where do I begin? Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem. I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now. Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some.Whenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you. You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with. You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack. If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want.This task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix. Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with. Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die. In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes.As the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing. If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge.There is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons.Pros:-Lots of replayability. You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh. EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game.-Smart building. You can't just build a castle in the sky here! There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void.-Friendly Community. This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life.Cons:-Updates. The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times.-Learning Curve. There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up. 7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players. I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing. After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier.-Graphics. If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you. The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at. The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at. The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected.Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time. It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic. I would reccomend at least trying this game out, I think that you will enjoy it!

								im 65 and been playing games since the early 80s, i have around 1500 hrs gameplay in 7 days to die game and must say that this game is on the same fun level as half life when that wonderfull game first arrived. everything in the world is destroyable and everything is useable, everything that lives in the world is killable and can kill you. i will be playing this game till the day i die both single player and with my friends. it is slow in moving forward to a full release game but the money has to come from somewhere and funpimps are not a huge company, imagine this game if funpimps were as big as bethesda or the other big game companies. the fact that this game is so playable even in its unfinished state should tell you all you need to know. keep hard at it funpimps its a yes from me and your through to the finals.

								Three friends and I spawn in the wasteland biome.Thought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex.Was going well at first.Gathered many supplies.Fortified the door.Was supposed to be temporary, started turning into something permanent.Everything was going well.they broke down the door...Everything went to hell.They started pouring through the stairwell.Dogs everywhere.The only way out was down.Started running down and dodging walkers.We got separated in half.Two of my friends made it out.My other friend and I were still stuck inside.Figured we'd spend the last night, hiding.The moaning of walkers never stopped.Morning came..It was time.We had to go.My friend and I continued to drill down passed the horde.Got desperate.I jumped out the second floor.Broke my legs.They were everywhere.Managed to limp through the horde.Met up with my other three friendsDon't look back..We crossed the river into a forest.Started off with a small shack.Turned it into a four house village.We had a wall, a trench around it.We had something.We never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland.That right there, is just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like. Very few may say that ""Oh, it's just another zombie survival game"" or ""Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff"". Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all. I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd. I have to say that this is the best one. Why?1. The developers are actually going in the right path.2. Loot system is pretty awesome.3. Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to. But, still awesome.4. Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system. Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support. Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you. Which has happened to my friends. It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure.5. The different variety in enemies is cool! Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that.6. Speaking of zombies. This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have. You know... They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers. There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself ""No, I'm good"", because they actually threaten you. The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game. To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde. Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere. This is also unheard of in DayZ. You never see a horde in that game. Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher. You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening. Zombies are also smart.7. There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead. This game does a very good job at that. You can do almost whatever your mind imagines.. Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it? Do it. Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own? Do it. Want to build a huge wall around your base? Do it. However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help. Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall. We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots.These are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing? This right here, is just an alpha.. A ♥♥♥♥ing.. Alpha, and the developers have already come this far. As I type this, the alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now. This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen. This game is going nowhere but up.Unfortunately, I can't tell you about the PvP, because my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together. I have no idea how well PvP works. If I ever play PvP, I'll tell you how it goes.Get. This. Game..It's a solid 15/10.

								( Updates at bottom. )A friend got this game for me, I looked at the title, looked at the screenshots and groaned. ""Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'."" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot. I'm rather glad I did.I started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty. Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area. Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in. My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls.50 days in, I'm more than hooked. Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day. Shelter, security and stealth at night. Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin. Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone. More? We built a second story for storing items. More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a ♥♥♥♥♥ for us living people to cross. More? Another story, turned into a rooftop farm of corn, blueberries and potatos. Nights can get rough at the ""Spillway Estate"" as we have now dubbed our fortress, we try to keep quiet throughout the nights, limiting player activity to things that dont make sound, or carry foods on our person that generate smell. ( Yes, that's a thing!) A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons. Pistols, a shotgun and some ammo for it, fresh from the forge! when things get really bad- The newly crafted fallback point, a basement/bunker. Metal walls , floor, and roof, only one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies. Beds, emergency food and water (or tea!) supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons. ( Chainsaws, landmines, a rocket launcher, and a whole lot of shotgun ammo! )To sum it all up, it has a few minor bugs, but it's in alpha, and they generally get fixed up rather swiftly! Worth the money, great with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!Lots of potentiel, and fun as is.9/10(Aug 19, 2014 Update: 1)Been awhile since I posted this, but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this. So I thought I owe it an update due to the many, many changes to the game:Crafting: Crafting is mostly the same beast as it was when I started, though so, so much more crisp now than it was before. A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger). You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves. (A wooden frame - Wooden block. - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block.) As well as many other types of similar things, it's rather neat I think.Random world generation?! I admit the same ol' world was getting a bit old and such. So when I heard they had a random world with some neat UI upgrades I was excited. And it is nice, though has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old world, but still adds a great stuff. Maps now have a ""fog of war"" making it harder, and more exciting to go scavanging!To come? I heard character creation comes at the next big patch. Could be wrong though.My rating remains the same.

								I originally played 7DtD for barely 3 hours when I first purchased this game because I didn't see the hype and that was a HUGE mistake seeing as I only made it to Day 2 (I'll give details on that in a bit) and in that time I died twice (I collapsed my base and then did the same with my mining tunnels) I got annoyed as I thought the game was broken and buggy, I then looked at the design, the fact that gravity affects structures, the fact that you can get cold, or overheat if you work for too long, the fact that if you get an illness and don't treat it you'll lose wellness, it's got a sense of realism that I've only honestly ever seen this game provide.The main aim of the game is to survive, you begin by building a base, getting some farms going for food, finding lakes for water, you go and raid some towns that you found whilst exploring to find the perfect spot for your base, and start making better tools, this is the first part where you need to be careful: There's a heatmap, if you make a forge or a mixer to get your base stronger you'll start to generate heat based on usage and that... Can draw zombies, you need to work out if you REALLY need the forge running 24/7, or your Campfire running to cook those extra eggs. Then you look to the top of your screen and realize... It's day 6... 23:48, panic sets in, you know that in less than 18 hours you're going to have some unwanted friends because: Each day you hit that's a multiple of 7 (7/14/21/28/35/So-on) the horde attacks, you can't just hide in your base and crouch whilst praying they cant see you, you're hunted constantly, you need to plan ahead and build a bunker, or get ammo together to defend yourself actively, your base defenses hold them off for a time but they begin to shatter, the spikes you laid down begin to collapse under the sheer weight of the rotten, malodorous corpses baring down on them, your walls begin to crack as they're relentlessly pounded on by the undead hordes that seek to make you their next meal, then... a friendly jingle plays, it's 6AM on Day 8, a smile crosses your face as you realize you survived, you realize that once you've slaughtered this wave of undead fiends you're mostly safe for another week, your bow thunks a final arrow into the Burned Survivor and he drops to the ground. Relief washes over you as you set to work repairing and strengthening your base.Exhilaration,Panic.Joy. Despair.Hatred.Nervousness.Anxiety.Pure unadulterated pleasure as you let loose a crossbow bolt into the zombies that berate you for breathing. This game will make you feel things you've never experienced before, my review barely scratches the surface, PLEASE, genuinely give this game a go, I promise you'll never regret it.

								Considering the amount of hours I've poured into this game, I believe a proper review is far overdue. To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build. My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy. This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play. This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back. I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended. Then, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it. He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more. Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader. By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game... or at least we thought we did at the time. I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs. We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60. Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us. We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes. We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for. But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers. We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert. As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger. It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night. We were victorious.From that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game. With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15. With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters. Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more.So, do I recommend this game? Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game. You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't. You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited. The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't. So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better.10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway.

								First time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt....Sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside.I felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen.....Its rare a game can do that to you.Pros:Great extensive crafting mechanicLootingZombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runMining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingCons:DOGS, $^#@ themStill in alpha so some glitches may occurPerformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downAll in all though i give this game a strong 8/10 -The Fun Pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes-It can be insanely addicting to play-I love the mining and crafting mechanics-The fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity-LOTS OF REPLAY VALUEI am not good at writing reviews but I hope this helps at least one personFINAL VERDICT:  BUY THE GAME

													Early Access ReviewUPDATE:While I haven't played the game at all recently, I felt as though I needed to update this review to reflect on some of my experiences over the past couple of years. I have picked the game up again on occasion, but didn't find myself as content to continue playing as I used to be. There have been many changes over the past couple of years; mostly in terms of your character having a skill and perk system, which is a nice addition and adds a lot of RPG-feel elements. However, the game suffers from something I feel a lot of survival games lack; 'end game' replayability.Being a new player in this game is fantastic, as written in my original review below (long before I had so many hours played), but the fundamental problem is that once you are established, once you have access to creating your own munitions and have the hardware to farm resources effortlessly, the game becomes quite stale. I'm sure the addition of more NPC's etc. in the future will amend this, having a reason to leave your stronghold and go out into the world, but I feel as though the developers are perhaps setting their sights a little too high.A recent cross-platform release (consoles, *sigh*) was met with a huge backlash of negativity, mostly because the game needs so much work - not in terms of content, the game has an endless amount of items and block types and there is still the potential for a massively popular RPG/Survival experience in this game. The problem is that some of the core engine mechanics really, really need work. Movement feels sketchy, aiming weapons and firing them feels far from smooth and the game doesn't exactly run smoothly at high settings even with beefy hardware. This was forgivable 2 years ago, but for it to still be playing this way is dissapointing.I still hold out hope for this game, and I'm sure I will return to it, but I would love to see the developers iron out the creases in the core game mechanics instead of having such an enormous amount of focus on adding new things. Finding poop in toilets and having the ability to throw that poop is hilarious, turning that poop into compost to grow crops more efficiently shows great ingenuity, but I only wish they would iron out the creases before adding to the already vast amount of items/blocks/locations etc.I have no doubts about keeping my review positive - this is a fantastic game. I would still recommend this game to new players without hesitation, it is a great experience, especially with friends, but for it to become a true blockbuster, I feel the developers need to take a step back and improve on what is already there.Original Review From October 2014My first time playing this game was one of the most enjoyable noobie experiences I've ever had, digging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding inside, starving and hoping nothing would find me, seeing sunrise has never been such a relief. After some exploration and scavenging for food and water, I found a town, thinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at night.What a mistake that was, a horde came for me and trashed my defenses, the few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no time, and I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape route, my friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies. ""I see daylight, I've found a way out!"" Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friend, looking up at me, with the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under him, barely a block left to stand on. I told him not to look down, but naturally he did, what ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse words, desperation wouldn't be a fitting enough word to describe it.Genuine adrenaline rushes and forever fearing for your life, this game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genre, being in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply won't cut it, you can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once again, you really need to think about how and when you're going to engage the zombies by choice, because when a feral horde comes for you, you won't have a choice, and you better be ready for when that happens.Not only is this game a great thrill-ride and at times a genuine tester for your grey-matter, it is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards co-operative gameplay. Sustaining yourself, by yourself, is indeed possible, but with friends you can assign eachother certain tasks, for example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneath, he spent most of his days underground mining, creating ammunition and such, providing me with raw materials, while I worked on our surface defences and food supplies. Do-able alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friend, or a few friends is even better, unless you are the hardcore lone-wolf type.I have yet to play on a ""no rules/ PVP"" server, I can imagine that adds whole new elements of fear-factor into the game, knowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuff, at their own discretion, or maybe they will help you, it's up to them, I may build the courage to try this someday, at the moment I'm happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE server.Overall this game is already almost a finished product in terms of crafting and survival aspects, there is the occasional annoying glitch/bug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing game-breaking as of yet. To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisation, experience points, more weaponry etc. is a very exciting thought indeed. I can see this game making a huge impact on release, it is genuinely brilliant fun.Highly recommended, especially playing with friends!

								A16 ReviewAs a die hard veteran of this game it has been 'suggested' by various friends on Steam that i write a review.(Write a reivew after only 6,000 hours? Pfft...FINE)Away we go...Buy this game only if you fully understand what Early Access and Alpha stage game development truly mean.This game is incomplete and yet it still is one of most playable and enjoyable Early Access titles on Steam.Watch some current videos and educate yourself on what you're getting into before you buy this game.This game has a steep learning curve and while in game tutorials have been added the game does not hold your hand,Buy this game if you enjoy:-Fully destructable, randomly generated, ludicrously large game worlds.-Zombies-Crafting-Zombies-Survival-Zombie DOGS-Building system with structural integrity-Zombie BEARS-Mining-Exploration-Base defense (A16 added turrents and traps)-And yes, good ole' first person, zombie shootin' goodness.Did i mention that this game is incomplete?Yes? Well ok then, let's all say it together.7 Days to Die is an Early Access game which means that it is not finished yet.The developer plans on completion sometime in 2018.Updates for the game are about every 6 months.The developer is active but wants the game to be built right so is taking it's time.This game will not run well on a potato.Performance is good but rough on average hardware.Summary: Highly recommended for the reasons listed above.Worth every penny of the $25 i spent on it.

												After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

												I'm not saying its as good as the Witcher 3.I am saying I have not had this much fun since the Witcher 3.			 
				Posted: October 5
												Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity; an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the ""decisions"" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another; chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!

												An amazing game, with a lot up and downs. (Patch 1.1.1 + dlc december update)After more than 150 hours of gameplay I would like to share my opinion. (No Spoiler)Pros:1. An immersive, long and interesting main story which takes about 30-50 hours.2. A very big and detailed world with almost way to much to do and discover. If you want to do everything it will easily take about 70-100 hours or even more. So, better tell your friends and family that you don't have that much time for them and ask for some vacation. 3. A beautiful underwater world with sharks, a lot of fishes, manta rays and wals.4. The sea combat from AC III, black flag and rogue is back.5. The voice actors are amazing. I've played with Kassandra in german language.6. The soundtrack is like always amazing. ( Especially the different version of Ezio's Family.)7. A lot of features such as the photomode, an egale to discover, automatic walking,...8. Until now a lot of support with free content. Mastery system, +20 level and so on.Neutral:1. The graphics. Don't get me wrong it has very good graphics, but some textures don't look well. Trees and grass at far distance looking garbage. Some animations looking weird and heartless! Some graphics are really beautiful better than in origins, but some are not. I think that I've enjoyed the origins graphics more especially the syncpoint views.2. It's great to have a choice to choose what's happening in the story. I do like it much more than just to have a linear story even if it is not that great like in other rpgs such as in the witcher. And that's the problem.The most choices does not have a long term impact at all.3. They trying to do more with the abstergo story. It's ok, especially considered to everything after AC III, but sadly not as good as the desmond story which I really enjoyed.4. It's great to choose the gender to play as a female or a male, but it does not effect the story or any stats like a male is stronger, but not as agile as a female.5. The merchenary system is good. It reminds to some AC parts, the GTA wanted system and the shadow of war nemesis system. It's a nice idea, but I often felt interupted at discoverying.6. The romances are ok, but pointless. Mostly it's just an one night stand and nothing more.7. You can weak a region and fight for sparta or athens, but it's always the same and gets boring after a while.8. The sidequests getting better, but it's mostly the same thing gameplaywise. Kill this person, steal something, talk to a person and so on.9. The mastery system is one of the best things and fixes some contra points - but why is it only on neutral? Well, it does improves a lot of balancing, but only for endgame.9.1 Leveling up is not that pointless anymore. You can invest the new points into the mastery system, but you still have to be at least 3 level under your enemies until level 50.9.2 Stealth gameplay got improved a lot, but only in end game.Contra:The technique:1. The PC port isn't that great. It does have an exemplary graphic menu. Every setting explains what it does, but sadly the game isn't that great optimized. Most settings barely boost your fps. I'm getting a stable 60 fps at almost max settings. I've tested it on different cpus and my gtx 1070. This is definetly not that great especially considered that it does need 10-20% more performance than origins, allthough it doesn't look better. I hope that future updates does improve it. Everything else was fine for me. I didn't have any serious bugs, it didn't crash or frooze. The loading times on a ssd are fine.Balancing problems:2. The level cap is forced and not optional. I don't like it some people may, but me not.3. The combat in general is good, but does always feel like the same. Dodging is 95% the better choice than blocking attacks, which does make it pretty pointless.4. At some parts of the main story you have to do a lot of side quests to level up. It does throw you out of the story, which is really bad.5. Teleporting is much worse than in origins. You can't port anymore to discovered cities, which means that you have to walk a lot. You can only port to syncpoints. It wouldn't be that bad, but greece does have a lot of hills, which means that you have to climb a lot.6. No shields. C'mon. Just why? Antic greece and you can't even wear a shield?Microtranslations7. I've ignored it the whole time and progressed pretty fast through the story. You can collect orichalcum to get some things from the store with luck, but of course it's defintely nothing which belongs in a full price game!Grinding8. The grind is real. For real. Lol. I personally do not have something against grinding, but it's way to much. You have to upgrade your gear like every 10-20min. 9. You have to collect way to much resources. Upgrading your gear is extremly overpriced and not even worth cause you always get something better. (improved, but still expensive.)10. 2 months after release and still no ng+ mode. Very disappointing. Tip to boost your perfomance:If you switch the volumetric clouds from max to high it boosts your fps a lot by no visual difference. I'm getting about 7-10 fps more.Tip to level up ""fast"":Just accept every quest which you can get. A lot of side quests are similar. You can mostly do 2 or even more quests at the same time.Conclusion:Well, I do like every AC game. I do think that every part does have something special and their up and downs. It's also my favourite game franchise. That's also a big reason why I wanted to wait until I've finished the whole game before I do share my opinion. I had a lot of fun with this game.Is it the same as origins?It's almost the same, but much more to do, new and improved things, except things as graphics and performance. It's the better game and not exactly the same.Is it still an Assassin's Creed?Yes and no. No hidden blade, no assassins and no templars. So No. How could it even be? It's before the brotherhood has been created. BUT why yes? Well, in my opinion it's still an Assassin's Creed even if it is not the same feeling as for an example in the Ezio Trilogy, cause of the antic artefacts and present story.Which version should you buy?Well, it was already on sale and I would only buy it on sale now. I've bought the Gold Edition to play before release. Now I would only buy the normal edition. Buy the season pass/gold edition if you can't get enough. The season pass includes the 2 upcoming dlc's and AC III and Liberation remastered.How was the first dlc?It was fun, but with 3h to complete everything way to short. I mean I've expected that - a problem of episode releases. I want to play everything right after and not every X weeks. If I be honest and hard it's like almost every dlc these days it just feels like free content for money.What did they (not) change since release?They've increased the level cap by 20, added automatic arrow crafting, weekly events, which are repetive, easy and nothing special at all, a visual customization system, a mastery system and many other things, which expand the game for free. The perfomance, (balancing) and other negative points are sadly the same.What do I think after 2 months?Well, I'm honest the hype is over and the game doesn't interest me anymore since I've completed the game. It's very important to keep the game alive with good new content. Still no ng+ mode, which is very disappointing. I'm excited for the upcoming dlc's. For me it's the GOTY for PC!. I will try to update this review after an upcoming big update.Questions? Feel free to write a comment or send me a message. There is definitely more to talk about, but sadly you can't write more in the review.Thanks for reading and happy gaming!

												77 hours in, I have reached level 42 and I'm not close to finishing the main story, not even half way. Too busy completing side quests and everything else in this huge and incredibly beautiful game. Every time I decide to go for a main quest something else comes in the way. And to be honest, I do procrastinate the main story because I don't want Kassandra's story to end. I'm pretty confident to say that Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the best game in the series followed by Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed 2. I love Kassandra (Bayek and Ezio will always be my favorite assassins though), the story, the music and sound, the combat, the skills, the RPG elements, the world and how stunning and different every area is. Just as in Origins, the world feels so alive, if not a tiny bit more in this one. Of course it can be a bit repetetive sometimes with the grinding but I'm having so much fun doing it (so far). Odyssey is a really rewarding and satisfying game and does a fantastic job in keeping me motivated to do EVERYTHING. My mission is to 100 % Ancient Greece as I did with Egypt. :) As for this moment, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a masterpiece.

												 I give Assassin's Creed® Odyssey: 8.6/10 Time to complete: 46 HoursMinor Spoilers: I wasn't going to buy Assassin's Creed® Odyssey when it was first announced. It felt like a copy and waste of origins and didn't feel like an Assassin's Creed video game at all,  however the Greek mythology persuaded me otherwise and after playing the game for a while, I know I made the right choice.Personally, one of my favourite gaming franchises with an awesome game. Sure, it may not feel like Assassin's Creed, but for damn sure there is a lot of stuff to do in the game.ProsWe venture into Ancient Greece, land of the gods. Odyssey strictly follows the Greek mythology to it's lore and says true to it which makes the game all more historically accurate. In a stunning and immersive word of Ancient Greece, we have several Greek cities with their own unique diversity. Odyssey felt like one of those games where it just simply blows your mind about how huge the maps are and how insanely detailed they are. The map size is very big, so big that you have to use a boat to travel across each part of the Greek islands. We see many several historical figures shown in the game, such as the great King Leonidas of Sparta as well many other Greek mythological creatures, that you may also have to battle. And it's not just combat figures, there are also great people such as Pericles of Athens. These characters are developed to show how they were according to history which just improves the immersion. The character development for the main protagonists (Alexios or Kassandra) are done in the right way too. Every character that is relevant has their own personality and isn't bland.Odyssey is a sandbox of RPG elements, and so done in the right way. Choices influence the story and can lead to different outcomes depending on what you pick. Levelling is done through quests and clearing out various landmarks on the map. You collect, improve and dismantle various gear to make your character a lot stronger. The diversity in gear and appearance is huge in this game. Each gear matches the play style of your choice. Abilities are unique and have their own strengths and weaknesses. You can kill leaders in real time which can start a war and change the occupying region. Stuff like this keeps the game very interesting.The story itself felt didn't feel like an Assassins Creed story however, it doesn't mean I didn't like it. Odyssey is a very well made game with a unique story of its own. You venture into the life of the protagonist as they try to move on from the past whilst trying to destroy a certain organisation. My biggest factor for which I loved is that the side quests feel like a story of their own which can be really hard to do in a sandbox game. Odyssey doesn't fail to deliver that though.The music within the game is very Greek folklore. There is also homage to Assassin Creed 2' theme song with it's own Odyssey twist which I thought was a great throwback.Key PointsGraphicsImmersionLevelingStorySide QuestsMapHistory and MythologySoundtrackConsVery few cons about this game which shows why it's a masterpiece of it's own. One issue I had with this game are the cut scenes. I get that the Devs are trying to make the game impact because of the choices that you make but sometimes some cut scenes feel so weird and some dialogue doesn't make sense for example, one second Alexios could be angry then the next hes smiling. I just wish there was also more Assassins creed references too because it is an Assassins Creed game after all.Performance is always a huge factor in Assassin's Creed games. There could be some bugs that need to be fixed as well as some random NPC traits. I really hate it when you accidentally hit a Citizen, then a whole mob tries to take you down and you get a huge penalty for murdering civilians. Combat sometimes felt clunky and no where near realistic. I wish the combat was realistic because the history around the game sticks true to its lore. It's hard to predict dodges and parry effects which throws you off guard and also lead to death depending on the difficulty that you are on.Key PointsCut scenesFranchisePerformanceCombatI hope you enjoyed my quick review of Assassin's Creed® Odyssey. I highly recommend getting this game as Ubisoft did a great job improving the series with new elements and showing the great world of the Ancient Greeks. It doesn't always feel like an Assassin's Creed game but nonetheless, it has a great story of its own.youth is a state of mindGameplayStoryGraphicsPerformanceEnjoymentOverall87108108.6

												My action Review for this game has been Hijacked by the Cash Shop.""Time Savers"" and any other items meant to be sold to the players who've already bought your game is a disgrace.We paid you, Ubisoft.  You do not get to then peddle us with a Cash Shop.  You get a negative review for this horrible behavior.			 
				Posted: October 6
												I like the game! I like the graphics, the story and the general design.BUT! EVERYONE HAS TO STOP BUYING THE MICROTRANSACTION CRAP THAT SEEMS TO BE THE UBISOFT TRADEMARK THESE DAYS! If you stop buying it, they will stop doing it! Ubisoft has acctually put in grind walls in the game, and then put in ""time-savers"" that are expensive as ♥♥♥♥! Its disgusting behaviour from the developers. I will, because of this, give the game a negative review as a protest against this.			 
				Posted: October 5
												I really wish I could reccomend this game. Its a solid sandbox with a likeable protagonist and some really gorgeous scenery... but the microtransactions are so utterly shameless, disgusting and unnecessary that I just can't. They really are revoliting, pages and pages of additional purchases in a product that they're happily selling for up to $120. Now, if it were a cosmetic or two I might not be so irritated, but its in game items and xp boosters, and I in no way believe that they haven't balanced the game to pressure the audience into making those purchases.Ubisoft is not the worst company in gaming, but they're still scumming.

												I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky. After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools. It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.10/10, turns mothers into elite gaming machines			 
				Posted: July 14
												I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements. But now I see what all the hype was about.Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the start of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish. Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, you immediately sell the item with no confirmation. I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up.

												So, I have over 500 hours of gameplay on this thing. It's...a really good game. It has a calming atmosphere, its colors are beautiful, the music is like a lullaby; I've played this game when I was going through horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it kept me going. I highly recommend this if you're depressed or anxious about how you're doing in your life; this game helps you relax.

												I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum. Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work. Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten.

												i was not interested in Stardew Valley at first because farming doesn't seem to be my thing. i bought the game for the new multi-player feature to play it with a couple of friends.i tried it in single-player mode just to learn the basics, and for the next two weeks, playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping. this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on. i didn't know if i spent so much time in Stardew Valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game... but now i know it's both.i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in Stardew Valley. there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered... and you have all the time you need to discover all of them. you can forage and dig up things everywhere, you can socialize with townsfolks - each with unique personalities, likes and dislikes - and fall in love with them, you can mine the heck out of the local mines, and then mine the heck out of a limit-less mine elsewhere. you can play the game however you want, and Pelican Town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless.i recommend this game. i know my recommendation is just another one in a sea of positive reviews, but hey, it deserves my recognition still! thank you ConcernedApe and Chucklefish for Stardew Valley. this game is a good time :)

												TL;DR - A fantastic game worthy of whether you buy it on sale or not. I could've paid $60 for it and I still would be happy with my experience. The developer (ConcernedApe) should be proud of the work he's done here, it's a fantastically enjoyable piece of art.To start, I played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end. As a side-note, if you're going to play with a friend from the start, you want to enable extra cabins. The extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you. You can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but, if you're wanting to jump right into it, you'll next the extra.I'm a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original NES. It wasn't too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box I suggest enabling ""always on targeting marker"" in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming. Also, make sure you're not standing on the tile you wish to interact with, such as tilling land. My GF is not a seasoned gamer, this was her second game she's played on PC utilizing a mouse and keyboard. I had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part.There is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can't go wrong with any of them.Farming is easily the most profitable and you don't even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops. It's very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food, as well as quests that require various crops. If you only grow one crop, you'll missing out on other aspects of the game.Fishing is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game. Some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but, it's because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini-game. Crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire 'fish' for other endeavors and easy money.Mining & Combat these two are together because, they go hand-in-hand. You go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters. You don't become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game, you need to rely on placement, timing, and farming/cooking to help you have the easiest experience, especially once you're done with ""the mines"". Armor is your boots and buffs from food. Your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon, I've never used the ranged weapon in combat. Food restores energy and heals you; your crops and livestock can provide better 'food' that is actually cooked that provides buffs.Villagers are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them. There's a calender in town square next to a job board, keep track of birthdays, find out what people like, and given them those gifts. Doing so leads to extra content within the game. It's completely worth it.Foraging is actually beneficial and provides a source of income, food, and goods. You use your hoe on 'worm tiles' and you receive items typically for the museum. I suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn't get yet.All-in-all I'd say I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It's been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming. They did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get. If you can play with one extra person, farm life will be exceptionally easier. For each extra person, the more specialized you can get. Fishing is always relevant, mining is always as well. Farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds (or get a seed maker). With two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done, we're just down to getting the last pieces of 'end game gear' and wrapping up maxxing out friendships.A few tips if you do decide to get into it.Enable always on targeting marker.Don't stand on the tile you're tilling.If you have nothing better to do, go mining.Work on friendships.Work on the community center.Grow all the varied crops.Don't be afraid of the wiki, crops were my usual pages.Play with a friend if you can. Make a friend to play this with if you don't have one.All options are valid.Upgrade the watering can first (gold if you can)Upgrade the hoe next (gold too but, not as important as watering can)Don't worry about buying too much equipment for the mines, just bring food for healing/energy.The upgraded backpack is SO worth it, especially while mining.Don't concern yourself too much with min-maxing, it doesn't really matter.Be patient, take your time.If you're going to the mines, try to make 5 levels each time you go, the elevator saves progress every 5.Gather all of your crops no later than the 28th (they all day next season except some.)All crops die in winter.Store at least a couple of everyone. I kept the highest tier I could get, sold the rest.Use winter for mining and reorganizing (most useful for solo or duo play.)Most of all, have fun and relax. Don't stress too much.There's tons more tips but, this is a review. :PIt's a great game, worth every dollar. I don't regret buying this full price. The devs deserve it and I hope they can make another great game like this. Sci-fi next time hopefully!

												This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. Main story. The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.

												There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime. This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools! I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!

												I'm genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isn't stuck in an eternal early access, but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat. This is how it was done a decade ago, and this is how it should still be done.			"
